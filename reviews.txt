walmart.com	I bought this TV b/cuz I was tired of my old one. I was a lil skeptic b/cuz of the brand name. I did some research &amp; found out SCEPTRE brand has been around since 1984. I checked out how they have advance in making computer Monitors to TV&#39;s ... LCD...LED..HD &amp; 3D TV&#39;s. After reading the walmart.com reviews I couldn&#39;t pass up the price. Shipping 2the store was free, fast &amp; easy. Installation was a breeze even with hooking up my X-1 platform xfinity cable box, DVD player &amp; the picture was so pretty I decided to connected my computer with a Belkin F3X1982-10 VGA/UXGA Monitor Cable to the TV (I eventually put it on my wall) b/cuz the picture was so B.E.A.utiful. If you are thinking about buying a different brand name TV just b/cuz of the name... please don&#39;t!!!!! Save your $$$ you will be impressed with this one. GREAT BUY!!!!!!	Menu	11/3/2013
walmart.com	The screen came with a smudge in the lower corner. I contacted sceptre and sent pictures of it. They replied that it was caused by physical damage and was not covered by the warranty. I asked how they could tell by pictures. They replied they can tell by the lines. I could not see any lines. I also told them the set itself and packing material was not damaged. A few days later I told them the smudge was getting bigger and darker. They replied that the LED&#39;s were burning out and to take it up with the shipping co. Fedex. After that they stopped replying to my E-Mails. Very dissatisfied with customer service and will never purchase anything that is made by them.	Toggle Search	6/22/2011
walmart.com	This is my second purchase of a Sceptre, First one was a 51 about 2 years ago. Very impressed and decided to get this one for our bedroom. I would highly recommend this brand, and I think I got a great deal on both from Walmart.com.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	6/14/2014
walmart.com	For the price this is an exceptional value. Picture and setup are very good. Warranty and shipping excellent. Overall features and set up excellent.

walmart.com	We bought this for our twin boys bedroom Christmas Dec 2012. Well guess what - now 13 months later it has died. That figures as it is just past the 12 month Manufacture warranty too and I did not buy the extended warranty. It was used only 1 hour or less a day - if that. The signs of something going wrong before it totally messed up was when you tried to power it on, the blue LED on front showed it on but only remained as black screen. We could not power it off on the TV button nor the remote so we had to unplug it from the wall. That seemed to work for a few days and how we would be able to somehow get it powered back on. But today, after over 12 attempts of trying to power it on we finally some how we got it powered back on. This time I kept it POWERED on while putting it on the ROKU2 XS source hooked up to this TV since the ROKU has a screen saver. For now we are leaving it POWERED ON while waiting for a different TV we just bought from Walmart but this time we bought a different brand AND with the 4 year extended warranty. This Sceptre TV was awesome.. truly it was...but it died so quickly even though this TV was hardly ever used. If you dare to buy this, be sure to buy the EXTENDED WARRANTY.

walmart.com	I bought this to replace a failed 32&#34; Aquos, and while the picture may not be quite as good, it&#39;s not bad at all -- nothing I could find particular fault with, especially considering it&#39;s half the price I paid for the Sharp three years ago. The Sceptre name isn&#39;t that well-known yet, but they&#39;ve been making high-quality LCD computer monitors since 1993, so it&#39;s only natural that they would branch out into HDTV. This is a basic set, and you can tell that corners have been cut in a few places to meet the price point: for example, the remote control has a slightly cheap, plastic-y feel to it, and as others have commented, the audio is a bit flat; however, the latter can be successfully compensated for by adjusting the set&#39;s EQ settings. There is also plenty of control in the menu system for tweaking the video, aspect, and and other settings to your liking. Three HDMI inputs are a plus, and I like the headphone jack so I can watch it late at night without disturbing anyone. Can you get a nicer, fancier 32&#34; panel for an extra $80 to $100? Of course, and those so inclined might check out LG or Sony. But if you&#39;re looking for bang-for-the-buck value, this Sceptre is a great choice.	Search	2/11/2014
walmart.com	3 years ago I bought a similar tv, same size and specs for OVER $600. It was damaged in a move. So i needed a new one, I recently learned that ALL LCD TVS are manufactured by only 3 companies in China who then sells them to name brand companies who creat their own cases and resell them for MUCH more. This Septra TV has beautiful picture quality and sells for $249 online I am very pleased with my purchase.	Items in cart	6/1/2011

walmart.com	Up front I will tell you I&#39;m no expert on HD tvs. However, after purchasing this one I have become a fan of the Sceptre. I rated sound just below excellent as I have yet to hear a flat screen with good sound and this one does a decent job of sound. Picture and sound are both quite configurable and with the remote you can change between settings lightining fast depending on your preference and channel. As many have said on reviews of many tvs, it takes some tweaking to get it to your likeing but right out of the box it was very good. In fact, the more I changed the more I found myself going to built in settings for sound and picture. I don&#39;t have HD programming with my dish service but the dish receiver has a setting for widescreen which makes all the difference HD or no. I did purchase a DVD player and HDMI cable at the same time. With these, the picture is amazing and with all the different connections and settings I have found nothing I can&#39;t connect and be able to set to my liking and enjoyment. You won&#39;t be dissapointed with this purchase. I have noticed the specs are identicle to many so my guess is that they are made by the same manufacturer as some of the high end models. After setting this up my wife has been wondering why I don&#39;t watch tv with her... until she watched a movie with me on this one... now I&#39;m looking to buy another!

walmart.com	I bought this TV a week ago to use it as a monitor for my new computer. Also purchased this cable from Walmart to connect the HDMI port (1 Link Depot 2m Male Gold Plated DVI-D Dual Link to High Speed HDMI Cable) on the TV to the computer. I also have basic cable TV so I split the coax with a splitter ran one coax to the cable modem and the other to the coax connection on the TV. Now I can switch it from a computer monitor to watching TV with the remote control. Good Deal! It also has a VGA monitor connection in case you don&#39;t have a DVI port on your computer. So far I&#39;m very happy with it as a computer monitor and TV. It was very easy to set up and has a nice size remote control. The picture quality is good. You can&#39;t go wrong with this combination TV, Computer Monitor. Hope this helps!	5.0	4/22/2011

walmart.com	After having 2 Vizio Tvs die on me in just over 2 years. I decided to try this Tv . I use it in the bedroom. The picture quality is very good . I did find the sound quality was not that great , untill i adjusted it in the settings. I do love the remote that came with it. Its very easy to use. If you decide to have shipped to the store, it could take longer than 10 days and i did find that a big pain, i wish i had paid the extra for faster shipping. It was like watching a slow boat to china. It only had to be shiped from 2 states away.	5.0	3/16/2011
walmart.com	The price is the thing that attracted me to this TV. After reading the customer reviews I felt it was worth the gamble to buy it. With the money I was saving on price I went ahead and bought a 3 year warranty. I opted for the free delivery, was offered other options with nominal additional cost but wasn&#39;t in a hurry, to my surprise the TV arrived two days later. The unit was very easy to set up and had it on within 15 minutes of opening the box. This is my first time buying a large item online from Walmart and the experience has been very pleasant one.

Much lighter and bigger too. So far no problems, it&#39;s been about two weeks. I&#39;ll hope for a lot more years. It was shipped in half the quoted time, and on my day off so that was nice.	5.0	11/11/2013

walmart.com	I was looking at Wal-Mart.com the day before Thanksgiving to see what kind of deals were going on in the electronics. I saw this TV and the price especially. I have a dinosaur TV and thought it would be a nice time to make a change to an updated version. I ordered it online. It took a couple of weeks to come in because of the holiday sales, etc. When it came in and I took it home, I thought &#34;man this TV is light&#34;. The hardest thing about getting it hooked up was the stand that comes with it. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was because it did not come with the cable that I needed to hook up my HD satellite receiver. I had to go and purchase one to hook up the satellite. Once everything was connected, the quality of the picture was GREAT!! I told my husband, &#34;So this is what everyone has been talking about with HD quality TVs and receivers&#34;. I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase, especially since it was such a good price. Recommend to anyone who is looking for a new TV.	4.0	9/13/2013

walmart.com	the picture and sound quality in this LED tv are very acceptable. the LCD tv it replaced had slightly better color, but the greatly reduced power requirements more than make up for that in my off grid cabin. i have been able to rely solely on my solar panels to charge my house batteries even with these short and sometimes cloudy winter days, and since I installed this tv a month ago that means no more traipsing outside on cold winter nights to start and stop the generator, a very welcome difference!! one channel had some lines in it, so i contacted the online Sceptre tech support, and they told me it was in the signal. I doubted that, but contacted my satellite provider anyway as they recommended, and it turned out that the Sceptre techs were correct. They also helped me know how to connect it, since the input was different for my old tv. It is sure nice to know that they are available to help. this is just a great basic LED tv, nothing fancy. I believe it is as good as any other big name brand of its size and features, and for the price it can&#39;t be beat.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	8/15/2011
walmart.com	This is a terrible product and I regret buying it. I should have listened to the other warnings and poor reviews. You truly do get what you pay for. At the low price, I didn&#39;t expect it to be the greatest HDTV out there, but I did expect the thing to at least power up and turn on. I called the tech support number but it went to voicemail. What kind of company runs that way? Leave them a message and wait for a call back?! I don&#39;t think so!!

walmart.com	I am pleasantly surprised at how good the picture is on this under $200.00 TV. I understand that it is made using Sony parts and that is one of the criteria I used to choose it. I run it using a Sony TiVo DVR, which I got from Direct TV. I realize that the Direct TV and TiVo people do not exactly love one another!!! However, the Spectre code number 0313 does not work to program the remote, so knowing that the parts are Sony, I used a Sony code and it seems to work okay. But, every once in while when I am choosing programs to record in channel numbers 501 and above, it will slip out of HDMI1 into HDMI2 and I will lose the signal. Perhaps there is a better code than the one I am using. I do know how to get it back by using the TV remote Source button, so I do that. It is an inconvenience, however. All in all, a great TV for the money!	4.0	3/8/2011
walmart.com	When looking for a T.V. for my bedroom I came across this Spectre, which was a great bargain. I guess for what I paid I can&#39;t be that picky. The picture is O.K. although the colors are a little dull. The sound however is the absolute worst. It sounds muffled no matter what settings I put it on. At time the sound also goes in and out as if it&#39;s about to give all the way. I find myself keeping my fingers crossed hoping that It wont and that it will last at least for a couple of years, or give out now while I still have my warranty. If I had a chance to do it all over again, I think I would just spring for the extra hundred dollars or so and get a recognized name brand.	4.0	3/18/2011

walmart.com	Let me put it this way, this is a great television for the price you are paying. The only downside is that it&#39;s 720p. My rule of thumb is anything 32 inches or more should be 1080p. 1080p referes to how many pixels it has; 1920(left to right) x 1080 (up and down). It&#39;s a very simple concept, the wider you stretch 720 pixels, the less detail you will get, but Sceptre has still managed to get good quality out of it. If it was up to me I would make this 1080p and sell it for $5 more. Anyways, buy this TV because you won&#39;t be disapointed, considering what you paid for it.	5.0	11/22/2013

walmart.com	I am just now ditching my old 200 lb CRT tv for these new, thinner (lightweight) models. The picture on this tv is crisp and beautiful, and the sound is only tinny out of the box. Just like the tint, you must go into the menu and adjust everything to your personal liking. Once we struck the balance we liked for all the options (in about 10 minutes)--we were watching the most amazing picture and sound we&#39;ve ever owned. And we even attached one of those new flat panel amplifying antennas since we don&#39;t have cable, dish, etc. I am uber satisfied with this purchase. Yes, I&#39;ve only had it a few days, but it doesn&#39;t shut off by itself (it&#39;ll only do that if somebody inadvertently sets the sleep timer OR if you are on a &#34;no signal&#34; station for 5 mins. I also read among the reviews that people felt compelled to hook up their computer speakers to amp up the volume...I can&#39;t imagine why because it is so clear and loud on its very own that it isn&#39;t even remotely necessary IMO. My 14 YO son said the same thing--why would anybody deem that necessary? Perhaps there are some &#34;lemon&#34; tvs out there just like cars, but mine sure doesn&#39;t appear to be 1 of them. I highly recommend this acquisition, folks. :)	4.0	10/4/2011
walmart.com	I got this on sale from Walmart.com--under $200 including tax. I would have rated it higher but the instruction book is not overly clear. It looks like it would be but once you start actually trying to follow the instructions, not so much. We had a hard time getting it hooked up so it would play. We did eventually figure it out and have been really happy with the picture quality. The sound is okay but we&#39;ve had a little trouble hitting the sweet spot between too loud and &#34;Huh?&#34;. We still haven&#39;t figured out how to hook up the Xbox to the TV without having to disconnect part of the cable. Granted, we haven&#39;t spent a lot of time in trying to figure it out so far. One thing that contributed to the confusion is that they label the cable function as YPbPr. I don&#39;t get why they can&#39;t just call it &#34;Cable&#34;. Once we finally got it set up, we really love the TV. I&#39;d recommend it but be prepared to do some cussing and fiddling around to get it connected and working.	1.0	2/18/2014

walmart.com	Been using the TV for the past week and seems to be good so far. For the price I pay, I am quite impressed with the Color and Sound of the TV as compared to my other higher price TV.	1.0	3/7/2011

walmart.com	I have owned this TV for 4 months, now. I wasn&#39;t even aware what &#34;brand&#34; Sceptre was, but I was in desperate need of a new TV, and had a limited budget. I purchased this TV right at $190+tax ship2store. I couldn&#39;t be happier with it! To be honest, I don&#39;t use my TV a lot. Mostly college football games, the occasional video game, and I have a Roku 2 XL box that I also stream Amazon Prime movies with. I may go an entire week without even turning the TV on. So the TV, in general, is not being heavily used. The box that the TV arrives in is huge. The TV itself is pretty big, once it&#39;s out of the box and on the stand. Setup was a breeze. I don&#39;t have cable, but I do have an antenna. And with the digital tuner, my local channels come in crystal clear. It will take some time to get the settings just the way you like them. And if the TV is unplugged for any reason, the settings reset, which was a letdown. The 3 hdmi ports are more than enough for me, but others may feel they need additional outlets. The overall picture quality is above average. The contrast ratio is only 3000:1 (compared to an LG 32&#34; which is 70,000:1), so you&#39;ll get what you pay for. The audio does seem a bit low for different channels, so you&#39;ll find yourself with the remote in hand, readjusting the volume settings regularly. All-in-all, I would recommend this TV to any that wants to add an nice flat screen TV to accent any room. I would not recommend this for gamers or anyone wanting a complete HD experience. :)	5.0	3/12/2014
walmart.com	This tv was great for the price. The picture is nice and the sound is loud. I was very happy with it until it died. I bought this in May 2012 in April 2013 it would power on but there was no picture or sound. I still had 2 weeks before the warranty ran out. I filled out Sceptre&#39;s rma form online. They emailed me a prepaid shipping label, I had saved my original packaging so I didn&#39;t have to wait for them to send a box. It took a week to ship across country to them, a week to fix it and a week to get back to me. The process was very easy. It seems to be working fine now, we&#39;ll see how long it lasts. If you&#39;re going to buy this tv do yourself a favor and pay for it with a credit card that will extend the manufacturer&#39;s warranty for an extra year.	1.0	3/21/2014
walmart.com	The 3.5mm audio jack in the back didn&#39;t work, makes a weird noise. The lowest volume level is too loud at night. Picture was a bit pixel-y at times, like when there is movement on the screen it drags a little. The tv eventually died after 15 months. I imagine people who left a good review didn&#39; bother coming back when they had a problem later. After researching on the web, many other people have had the same issues. Since it is outside of warranty, Sceptre won&#39;t help. Don&#39;t fall into the same hole I fell in.	4.0	12/27/2011
walmart.com	Not a bad tv for the price but not a great deal. My main complaint is that there is no full screen option. If you go to cinema it cuts part of the picture off.and if you go to zoom the picture is not clear.	1.0	3/14/2011
walmart.com	The picture quality is horrible on this tv. It&#39;s like watching through fog- we will be returning it asap. The price was good but not good enough for this mess. Also the tv won&#39;t sync with Dish tv remote.	1.0	4/1/2011
walmart.com	1 year to the date, either the backlight or the power supply has gone bad. This is what I&#39;ve figured out by reading online forums with other people having the same issue. The center of the screen went very dim but the edges seem okay. Yeah, it&#39;s a great deal for a TV that size but if it&#39;s dead exactly one year later it&#39;s not a good bargain. Also, the manufacturer&#39;s web site is useless for finding answers or getting help. They really don&#39;t even have a functioning web site. That should tell you all you need to know about the Spectre brand.	Menu	5/1/2011

I was nervous because it isn&#39;t a name brand, and since I could only view it online I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. This price is by far the cheapest out there for size and specs it has. I am so glad I took a chance and bought this tv! I am sitting in font of it right now and this picture is perfect! Someone mentioned in there review that the sound isn&#39;t good, but I have to disagree, The sound is beautiful!

walmart.com	This is the second of two TVs I bought from Walmart. The first was a Viore 32&#34; Class LCD 1080p 60Hz HDTV, LC32VF56, but is now out of stock and may not be available again. The Viore had good reviews and I agree that it is a low priced, high-quality TV for $299. I was going to get two of them, but wanted to make sure it was what I wanted before buying the second one, and two weeks later it was out of stock. After some consideration that include a 37&#34; Viore I got the Sceptre despite it being a 720p. I own a Sceptre 22&#34; computer monitor that has been good so I was not too worried about the brand. I am using both of these TVs side by side as COMPUTER MONITORS! I needed some big monitors and if you by just a monitor they are more expensive. This way I have great monitors and they can also show TV, DVDs, and photos on USB flash memory. More value, less money. The 1080p should be your first choice as the resolution is higher. For me, the second monitor is 720p and it&#39;s ok. For HD TV I can&#39;t really tell the difference, but I have not watched them both at the same time. HDTV is very nice on both. The sound is a little better on the Viore than the Sceptre. Playing with the controls may help, but other reviews said the same thing. Don&#39;t expect HI-FI audio. Both work well with even a cheap antenna and I $20 rotator seemed ro bring in all the possible broadcast stations in my area. Non-HD is ok, and the HD looks great. I bought the extended service plan for both TVs. I don&#39;t normally do this, but I will be using them a lot every day and at $20 each for 2 years it&#39;s cheap insurance. If you buy a more expensive TV the coverage may be more. To use as a monitor for best results, make sure your video card can display 1360 by 768. I turn down the brightness as much as possible on all my monitors. The reason is it should make the backlight lamp last longer as I is the most likely thing to fail over time.	5.0	7/27/2011
walmart.com	I understand that you cannot beat this price but for 80 dollars more i can get a real name brand like toshiba or vizio and get full 1080p and much better sound quality.

walmart.com	I needed a low cost TV and this was in the right price range. I wasn&#39;t expecting much. But this turned out to be a very good purchace. Sound is good with an equlizer built into the set and the audio is run through HDMi, no RCA cords at all. Picture is good, I didn&#39;t adjust to the User settings, the factory settings are really good on this set. I can see the picture from the side well and as an added bonus the base swivels 30 degrees each way. I set this unit on my coffee table and can swivel it so I can watch It while I cook in the kitchen 20 feet away and the picture is still good. Easy to set up and they even put a nice little screw driver in with it. I was watching football 10 minutes out of the box! Remote works well, and they included a nice list of remote codes so it is easily programmable. I also got the extended warranty so I&#39;m good for the next 4 years. I purchased it online and it was delivered 3 days later right to my door. I am pleased.	5.0	1/1/2012

walmart.com	I ordered this TV thinking I would use it in our bedroom. After two days I knew it would end up as a guest room television. Picture is fine, although a tad dim when compared to our other flat panel TVs. Our biggest issue, &amp; one that makes me consider returning it to Wal-mart, is the poor sound quality. In fact we had to turn it to the maximum setting on one show to even hear above the central heat running. The speaker is quite tinny sounding. While it doesn&#39;t always require you to turn it up that high to hear, it does require it frequently. It&#39;s going to the spare bedroom and we&#39;re going with a name brand for the bedroom. I would spend the extra $50 and get an RCA or Vizio.	5.0	12/29/2012

Do not buy this product!!!! It is unreliable. If you consider the time it takes to unbox, assemble, wall mount, deal with customer service when it fails, remove it from the wall and return it you have invested more time and money than the cost of the most expensive TV on the market. Save yourself lots of inconvenience and buy a quality set.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	9/1/2011

One TV stopped working within the 90 day return policy with Walmart, so returning it was a breeze. The other 2 are having to go through Sceptre&#39;s &#34;so called&#34; warranty services and it&#39;s a total joke! They hold the customer responsible for shipping both ways, so it&#39;s going to be close to $90 for shipping alone, and the wait time I was quoted was 4-6 months for repairs.

We turned it on, it displayed the logo and then faded black. So we used the warranty service. Last week received a letter saying it couldn&#39;t be fixed and we were being sent a check.

The problem I have, 3 pixels that are stuck one red, one blue, and one green, not dead. Not a huge problem but very frustrating that something brand new doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;m hoping that as we use the TV they will unstick themselves. It will be returned in a few weeks before the 90 day return policy is up if they don&#39;t fix themselves with use.

walmart.com	Had TV for about one week from 11/7/13. Picture looks great. The only issue I have with this TV is it does not have separate RCA plugs for the video game.

This would be a benefit.	4.0	8/10/2011

walmart.com	Finally came out of the &#39;90&#39;s with this TV. Did not want to spend much, so was willing to forgo a few bells &amp; whistles. After researching, I learned that the 720p picture quality is indiscernible from the 1080p (unless you&#39;re sitting right next to it, and who does that?), and the fact that this TV does not have wireless built in was a non-issue since our satellite TV receiver has wi-fi. Had an issue with the sound at first, having to constantly adjust volume up and down, but after communicating with Sceptre&#39;s tech dept., learned that AVL (automatic volume level) should be turned off for sound consistency (AVL gives you that &#34;theater&#34; sound, where the music seems ultra loud compared with voices). Since turning off AVL we have enjoyed it much more. After a couple of weeks of viewing, we are very happy with our purchase (on sale at Walmart.com), delivered free to our front door.	3.0	12/11/2013
walmart.com	I purchased because it was made in America and the cost was great. However, Sceptre is not on the Comcast list so I have to use 2 remotes to watch TV.

I love that it swivels. I definitely would recommend buying this product.	1.0	6/19/2011

walmart.com	I bought this TV 2 years ago; it seemed pretty good for the money. It just died (went black when turned on - had to unplug to turn off). Apparently this Scepter TV has a defect that a lot of folks have experienced over time. Perhaps the capacitors blew out (which is what some say); the tv repair man quoted $100 to fix - isn&#39;t worth it. If you are clever with a soldering iron, perhaps you could fix it yourself with a kit. Consider that many TVs will last quite a few years - this one didn&#39;t for me and many other Scepter owners. Consider a different manufacturer. The Scepter Tech support phone line never answers the phone, nor can you leave a message.	1.0	11/18/2011

walmart.com	I bought this TV for my bedroom. It was fine until about 5 months later - then the picture went completely out. The sound still works fine. I did a little more research online, and it seems that this TV is notorious for breaking in some kind of way. Of course Walmart doesn&#39;t carry the warranty, so you have to pay to send it off to get fixed, then pay for them to fix it, and then pay to have it shipped back to you.

Contacted sceptre and they said to send it back to them; after a few weeks of not hearing anything I contacted them and they said they couldnt fix it and would be sending me a replacement tv. After about another 2 weeks I finally received it. We have had the replacement one for 1 month and now it has dark lines running across the screen. So in 3 months we have went through 2 new tvs. This is absolutely ridiculous! Do not buy this tv unless you want one that only works for a few weeks.	1.0	11/8/2013

I followed the instructions but it was loose so I took it apart and followed the instructions again. It was still loose. Other than this the product meets all the standards it stated. The color is great and the sound is great. I look forward to many enjoyable hours watching it as I sew. I put it in my sewing room to keep me company while I sew.	5.0	6/24/2014

walmart.com	2nd one i have bought in last few years. Bought an element in store and carried back to get this Sceptre. One in bedroom and one at a weekend cabin. Watch a good bit of concert dvd&#39;s and sports. Sound is fine as well as picture. I own a vizio flat screen and enjoy this one just as much. Not sure on the life of it yet, but for the money if i get 5 plus years out of it, i can throw it away when she quits breathing!	Toggle Search	11/8/2012
walmart.com	Bought 2 at the same time. Cheap TVs mean we can buy new ones with no regrets when these die. Quick and easy set up. Crisp picture. Bedroom set sounds great in a corner. Living room set sounds tinny and spreads outward, not forward. It&#39;s against a flat wall and we have an open floor plan. I adjusted the sound over several days, which helps, but we&#39;re going to need some extra sound equipment for the living room set. I wish the &#34;guide&#34; and the &#34;info&#34; information were combined. The clock settings are NOT great - we&#39;re in the Central Time Zone, but the 2 TV&#39;s show 2 different time settings (even on &#34;guide&#34; vs. &#34;info.&#34;), even though they&#39;re set the exact same way. It&#39;s frustrating, but we rarely watch TV programs (we do DVD&#39;s &amp; Netflix) so it&#39;s not a big deal. If you&#39;re going from an older TV &amp; aren&#39;t an avid viewer, the 720P/60Hz will be fine. No need to go for 1080/120. If you want to do any Internet stuff w/ it (i.e., Netflix, Youtube, etc.), you&#39;ll need an HDMI cable and a box - you can pick one up in any electronic dept. Overall happy with them.	Walmart.

walmart.com	I was a big fan of Sceptre for awhile now, and bought monitors and TV&#39;s from them religiously. However, I have now had 4 go bad on me, including one of these, and in less than a year under normal wear and tear. I cannot in good faith recommend this brand anymore, as the quality and durability seems to be inadequate anymore. Price and functionality are good, but I can&#39;t rely on these products anymore and am afraid to buy any more of their stuff. My 42 inch went bad, a 24 inch monitor went bad, a 32 inch went bad and now this one went bad, at least it was less than a year old so I am going to try to get a new one under warranty. I wish I could rate it higher, as it is always nice to have a brand that you can trust and a good price, however either I got a few bad one&#39;s or Sceptre is delivering inadequate products anymore, either way, good luck if you choose this brand and model, it seems to be a toss of the dice anymore.

walmart.com	I bought this TV a couple of months ago. My experience with Walmart was fine and dandy. The TV was great for a while. But after three months, my TV just died. It had no reason; I had it in my room and I used it only a couple of hours per day. One day, I turned it on, I got a faint smell of something burning and the picture was gone; I only had sound. (It didn&#39;t catch on fire, it was probably something that ave in inside the TV). Walmart doesn&#39;t cover a product after a month of purchase so I had to contact Sceptre and let me tell you: worst customer service ever!!!! You have a hard time contacting a representative, either by phone or email. When you do, it&#39;s a guy that speaks broken English and only gives you what looks like prerecorded answers. They expect you to save the original box so you can send it for repairs. if you don&#39;t, they&#39;ll send you one WHEN they feel like sending you one and IF it arrives. Again, it&#39;s not Walmart&#39;s fault. And I have never ever had problems with any TV until now. So buy at your own risk.	Invalid city, state or zip code	11/22/2013
walmart.com	We bought this TV because the name brand that we recognized that was a great deal was, of course, sold out online. We hooked it up and it worked beautifully - the first night. Starting the second morning the TV would come on for a few seconds then blink off for a few, then come back onto the channel for a few seconds, then blink off. We called tech support three different days and always got a message machine. They never called us back so we boxed the TV up and traded it in for an Emerson. Be careful, if you buy this for the good deal, there does not seem to be customer service or tech support!	4.0	3/23/2011
walmart.com	TV is for bedroom on basic cable no box. The tv was packaged beautifully. Everything was in resealabe plastic bags. Came with cleaning cloth for the screen. Set up was a breeze.

walmart.com	I&#39;d been chomping at the bit to upgrade from my old 19&#34; tube TV to a flat panel HDTV for a long, looooong time. My first thought was that I didn&#39;t want anything smaller than 37&#34;, and nothing with less than 1080p. When I found this deal online, however, I decided I could probably live with a 32&#34;, 720p television. Was I right or what? I hadn&#39;t taken into account how small my living room is, and I do believe anything larger than this would have been overwhelming in it; and the 720p is far superior to what I&#39;d been watching, even without an HD source. This is the perfect TV for me - just the right size and with enough clarity to make me just sit with my chin in my hand and sigh. It was light enough for me to carry from my car into my apartment with no difficulty whatsoever, and set up from entering my apartment to unpackaging the TV to having it sitting on my TV stand watching television was less than 20 minutes. I definitely recommend this for those who want a lot for a little money!	5.0	10/8/2013
walmart.com	We bought this in February and I fell in love with it. I like the way the sound works on it. It&#39;s not going to blow out the windows but for what I needed it for it was fine. I loved the fact that it had a headphone jack, for a standard headset which I was hard pressed to find in a tv in this size. The picture was great, very clear, easy to adjust. It has THREE HMDI ports, along with a USB, DVI, and a number of other ports. It had a sturdy stand, and a mounting plate on the back. It has a lot of screen aspect ratios for different uses. Until this month this thing was perfect and I would have recommended it to anyone. But this month it&#39;s developed what I have come to find out is a big problem with this brand. It&#39;s flicking off on the screen but not the sound every few minutes. It started out every half hour or so, now it&#39;s every 5 minutes or less, for a few seconds. From what I&#39;ve found out its probably a power supply problem, something about bulging or bursting capacitors and they are a pain in the rump to replace. I am going to have to replace it, and unfortunately it probably won&#39;t be this brand. I really wish I could recommend this tv because until this happened I really loved this thing.	4.0	12/30/2011
walmart.com	I needed a TV for my bedroom and this was the cheapest one I could find. I&#39;m not super picky, so I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have a problem with the mentioned low quality picture and sound, which I don&#39;t. I have two problems. One, the remote. I have no idea why, but the remote doesn&#39;t work sometimes (I&#39;ve tried changing the batteries and all that). It only happens when I&#39;m playing DVDs. I&#39;ll try to change the volume and it just won&#39;t respond. This was happening early on, but I attributed it to the fact that I was switching between my DVD player and Wii, but I&#39;m not anymore and it still does it. Second, my DVD player and Wii both use the same ports to connect and there is only one set of those ports, but multiple HDMI ports (of which none of my devices use). I have to unplug one device to use the other.	2.0	1/18/2012

walmart.com	I bought my TV from Walmart (this has nothing to do with walmart service) about 2 months ago. I went to turn my TV on and the led light blew out after only 2 months. After I went on to sceptres website (which was a joke) I found out it only had a 90 day warranty (another joke) and luckily mine had blown out before my 90 days were up. I tried calling and emailing sceptre to see how I could return or get the tv fixed, it took 3 days to get anyone to answer me. They finally sent me a box to ship the TV to them and when the box got here I realized that they were going to make me pay for shipping; which would have cost more than the TV itself. So i brought the tv back to Walmart and thank god they were able to take it back. So a big thanks to Walmart and a lesson learned to buy from a new brand. You get what you pay for. I would not recommend this brand to anyone.	4.0	6/24/2011

I bought this tv in May and I now have to unplug and plug back in about 10 times to get the picture to come on. It&#39;s not worth the return shipping to use the warranty so I will be purchasing a different tv. Make sure to do your research before buying a tv and pay a little more to get a better brand.	1.0	12/10/2011

walmart.com	I hate having to replace loyal old electronics like televisions, but, it has to be done sometimes. My huge, old, heavy Toshiba t.v. finally died. Rats. Walmart to the rescue! I wanted a decent size unit to replace my old living room set. This television fits every single bill for me. I love it. It was even delivered three days before expected, which was awesome, and an absolute breeze to set up. I can actually pick this thing up and move it around without help. I can&#39;t even get my old t.v. out to the curb because its so heavy. The only problem I have with it, and it probably isn&#39;t an issue with the t.v., but with the cable company, is that I can&#39;t configure the television to work with my cable&#39;s remote (Comcast.) I have no clue what code to use, but I&#39;ll see if Comcast has a solution. The set has great resolution and sound. I really love it!	5.0	2/26/2014
walmart.com	I bought this to be used as an occasional TV at an apartment that my wife and I use out of town. It was cheap and I figured worth the risk. I unboxed and connected at our house just to try it out before taking to the apartment. My wife and I were so surprised at how good the quality was that we&#39;ve kept it in our bedroom as a TV we use quite often. The picture quality is very good. It has multiple settings you can tweak to make it just as desired. The sound quality while not superior is very good and we definitely have no problems with any movie our game used with it. The TV has muliple conneciton points and I believe 3 HDMI ports. We have it connected to an HD receiver and gaming system and are very satisfied with the overall quality. My only problem is that I wished I had bought 2 so that I&#39;d have one to take to the apartment now.	5.0	8/22/2014

I brought it home, unpacked it, followed the directions for assembly and hook up. When I turned it on, I got a brief glimpse of the Scepter Logo as the picture flickered off and on. Thinking it only needed to &#34;warm up&#34; I finally got the settings made so I could see the TV and off it went! Nothing but a black screen and no sound. I called Sceptre Customer Support TWICE and both men I talked to said it was a DEFECTIVE SET and to take it back. I took it back and got a refund. I would not recommend this TV. It looks good, great features and fantastic price but if it doesn&#39;t work, none of that makes any difference!	1.0	12/24/2011

walmart.com	I bought this tv in April 2012 because it was cheap for its&#39; size. After about 7 weeks I found out why. The picture shorted and the screen remained black when I turned the power on. So I sent it back to the manufacturer under the limited warranty so they could fix it. It took about a month for them to send it back fixed. Then today I came home and tried to turn it on. The sound came on but the screen remained black. After about 30 seconds of the tv being on, it filled the entire bedroom and bathroom with a horrific smell of burning plastic. So in 7 months I have to pay to ship this back to the manufatcturer to get it when and I have no assurances that even though this tv still falls under the one year limited warranty that they will even be willing to fix it a second time. Save yourself the time and aggrevation. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND OF TV! IT IS WORTHLESS!!!!	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/5/2013

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s still under warranty but that&#39;s just a whole bunch of hassle I don&#39;t have time for. I would sooner just buy a new TV from a trusted name brand.

My wife took all the info to our local Walmart and was told the only way to get the new price was to return the items and reorder.

As for the Sceptre 32&#34;....what&#39;s not to like. I see a lot of people complaining about the sound of their tv&#39;s.

walmart.com	Setting: Christmas morning. T.V. was fairly easy to set up. I was actually impressed with the picture while it was working. The speaker on the left side vibrated horribly at about 2/3 of the volume. Even after I adjusted the &#34;EQ&#34;, it still had the sound of a transistor radio. If I held the left side with my hand it would stop. About the 5th time I turned the unit on, it just petered out. After that the only thing I could get it to do was change the power light from red to blue. This is probably an extreme case for this product, but I believe when it comes to electronics you should aim for higher quality than this. My dad was looking for an inexpensive flatscreen for my Mom and what he got was a high dollar paper weight. If you decide to go with the Sceptre (which I now call the De-Sceptre), I would definitely buy the extended warranty.....but really, why bother.	Clear search field	8/26/2011

walmart.com	I have been shopping around for a flat screen and have not been successful but then my aunt suggested that I check Walmart.com because I had done a great deal of my Xmas shopping there...I did as she suggested and found a nice Sony on sale but I ended up with the Sceptre piece of junk because she decided to buy it for me as a gift. I was so happy that i had finally got my flat screen...I hooked it up two days after and was satisfied...later that same night, the screen went blank but the TV&#39;s power was still on...I played around with the settings and it stopped going blank...i thought that was it...during the night, it went blank 3more times but i thought i was because i was leaning on the remote...I removed the remote from the bed...when i awoke the next morning, the tv wouldnt stay on for even 3mins at a time...i called the company and they are just calling me back 10mins ago..(3days later), not to mention that the manufacturers customer service reps are so rude ...i am so disappointed...I cant watch tv, play movies or video games...i am mad at Walmart for carrying a piece of junk like this tv...how ever Walmart has agreed to take back the television although i have thrown away the box so all is forgiven... tomorrow I will go to Walmart and purchase a better quality television... IF YOU VALUE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY....&#34;SAY NO TO SCEPTRE!!!&#34;	Items in cart	12/27/2011
walmart.com	I purchased this television for my husband for the bedroom. I have returned it and purchased a VIZIO for a little more money at Target. The sound and picture on the Sceptre were poor. The sound was tinny and the color was dull. Waited a long time for a different TV and wasn&#39;t going to settle for the Sceptre. Very disappointed because I relied on the reviews so had to go through the hassle of standing in line to return the product.	Enter city, state or zip code	12/30/2011
walmart.com	I ordered this television through the ship to store feature on walmart.com. Upon receiving the television and taking it back home, I found that there was no picture AT ALL on the screen. When I called Sceptre&#39;s customer service line, it was obvious that the CSR had heard of a lot of these televisions were shipped DOA or that he received a lot of the same calls from other customers. This television is garbage; spend an extra $150-$200 and go with a real television producer. I will never buy from Sceptre again.	Invalid city, state or zip code	5/14/2012
walmart.com	I bought this tv for my daughter&#39;s birthday and after two weeks the screen started malfunctioning. When the tv is turned on the logo will flash for just a second and the screen will go black with only the sound working. I can repeatedly turn it on and off and eventually it will start working again. After several attempts to reach Sceptre customer service and going to voicemail with no calls back I am returning it.	4.0	9/27/2012
walmart.com	At first we thought we had a great deal. Nice picture, good sound. Perfect for the bedroom. But after two weeks the picture would not come on. We turned it off and then back on, and it worked. a week later we lost the picture again. Only this time the picture never came back. Only the sound.	4.0	12/5/2012
walmart.com	We bought this TV in December! Here it is April---4 months later, and it quit working altogether. First it just kept shutting itself off, then it just refused to come back on. We are trying to deal with Sceptre to get it repaired. Probably have to pay a bunch just to get it shipped to Sceptor. Plus it&#39;s supposed to be sent back in it&#39;s original box with original packaging materials. Who keeps that ??We obviously had thrown that away. So, I&#39;m not feeling very confident about getting my TV repaired! My advice to anyone is DO NOT waste your time and money on this TV! I&#39;ll probably end up at a local dealer, paying more, but getting a better product!	3.0	11/10/2013

walmart.com	I purchased two of these televisions and they seemed okay but one of them stopped working after about 3.5 months, I could not get a picture. I did not purchase an extra warranty and of course the 90 day replacement warranty had expired so I had to buy another T.V. Even though the other one that I purchased is still working the quality is just not worth it for the price.	1.0	2/27/2012

walmart.com	I am sorry to say this but invest in this TV is a waste of time. I bought three of these tvs in the same day and when I took them to my house only one of them came with damage I could listen it but not showed any image. I returned it to the store and they gave me my money back and as I ignored the signals and keep the others 2 tvs and go and I bought other to replace the damage one. After four months one by one these TVs were losing the image. Be prepared to pay for shipping and handling after four months of having it with you. The image disappears and you can only hear the sound. When I tried to solve the problem with them, they send me empties boxes to return the TVs. They fixed them but meanwhile nobody returns me the time that I spent on these and the fact of be carrying these TVs from one side to other and also I had to pay for shipping and handling. This is the worst investment of my life I end up paying what I would spend in TVs of a recognized brand. Do not invest money in these tvs and if you like to buy it please keep the box for when you have to send it back for repair.	1.0	11/11/2011
walmart.com	this TV is not worth money. I have owned the tv for less than a year and guess what I turned it on today and now it doesn&#39;t work at all.

walmart.com	we bought this tv 5 months ago and one morning we turned it on and the picture went out of it,had voice but no pic.2 times since we got it I turned it on and nothing came on,so I unplugged it for a minute and turned it back on and that worked.This time nothing worked.we called the company 2 times and of course no answer and no call back!! We feel the tv should last more than 5 months!!	5.0	10/2/2013
walmart.com	I thought the price was very appealing. I had read a few reviews and I thought for the price of the tv the rating was reasonable. So I bought this item and it was shipped to the store right away. The hubby picked it up while I was out of town. When I got back in I set it up. The packaging was great they even included a screw driver which I thought was good idea. The stand was a little flimsy and the tv wobbles even though I was sure to secure the screws well. I hooked up my roku player and the sound is great. However, every 30 seconds to 2 mins the picture was just going out but the sound stayed on. So I hooked up my laptop to see if maybe it was connection. That kept shutting off as well. I figured maybe there was a setting that needed to be adjusted.Nope!!!!. So this evening we will be lugging this junker back to Walmart. That&#39;s what I get for being cheap.	5.0	3/20/2011

walmart.com	This TV did not work at all. On Christmas day when my son, who this was a gift for, plugged it up to connect it the picture came in for 2 seconds and blacked out. He turned it off and on several times and got the same thing. The TV would not stay on. I returned it to Walmart the day after Christmas and wasn&#39;t able to purchase another TV from Walmart in the same price range. I went to BEST Buy to purchase a TV that worked.	5.0	11/28/2011

walmart.com	While a good price, and not bad for a bedroom; we were very disappointed in the sound quality of this TV. It is very tinny - probably because the speakers are at the back and facing down. Not sure that I would recommend this for daily use or to a friend for purchase.	1.0	3/29/2012

walmart.com	I looked at all the great reviews on this before purchase. The features of the tv were good in terms of the packaging, setup, types of inputs and even the picture for the limited time we watched it. Price obviously seemed good as well. The sound was pretty bad though. I&#39;ve had my share of LCD/LED TVs, so it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand that the sound isn&#39;t great on the TVs. The issue was with this unit. The different tones or whatever were very different in terms of the sound output. You would have to turn it up to hear some things in the same show and other parts of the same show would be very loud. My wife noticed it as soon as we plugged it in. It&#39;s not worth a little cheaper of a unit if it&#39;s this bad. I am returning this and will be getting another Samsung, which I&#39;ve loved in our living room.	5.0	4/16/2012

walmart.com	I bought this TV and had it a total of two weeks. It began pretty good; picture was not that hot but for a $200 set it was decent. After the first week, the volume began acting up; you would have to mute the set then un-mute the set before you could adjust the volume. After that, a small line of malfunctioning pixels started showing up in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and grew until it was about half the screen. I returned it to my local Wal Mart and am looking into a different replacement.	Toggle Search	4/26/2012

No picture, smell of burning wires. Dead. Sometimes, when something seems too good to be true, it really is. Buyer beware.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	6/30/2012
walmart.com	I bought this as a replacement for a broken tv. It seamed to have good review around the web and the price was in my budget. It worked ok for 2 months. Then this morning the screen is BLACK and i can hear the nice news lady giving me my morning weather report but there is not sound. I checked the manufacures webs site and they said unplug it for 10 min and try again. Still nothing. So i try and call and it just rings into a service that asks you to leave a message and someone will call you back. There is no live chat will almost 9am PST but im not holding out hope that someone will acutally be on it. I&#39;ve printed out my return code and taking it back to Walmart after kids off to school. Am very disapointed that this seams to be a VERY common problem with this TV. I should have read more review before buying it but to find that the most common complaint besides picture is a BLACK screen i will never buy this brand again.	Clear search field	8/29/2012

walmart.com	I had never heard of the brand but the size was what I was looking to buy and the price blew the competition out of the water. It took a phone call to my server to get the digital channels to load but once done, I am very pleased with the quality of this product for the money. Picture is clear and sound is stronger than most flat screen televisions without additional sound implements. I bought this for our bedroom and only expected to watch it a for a few minutes before I went to sleep at night, but it is so clear and easy to watch, I sometimes crawl up on the bed in the middle of the day to watch a show instead of watching the big screen in our family room.	4.0	11/28/2013

walmart.com	This TV was very easy to put together &amp; install. I choose it for the affordable price &amp; because it allows me to install a headset.

So far she seems to be happy.	3.0	12/4/2011
walmart.com	I was really skeptical on purchasing this TV mainly because of the name brand. Never heard of it and wasn&#39;t sure of its quality. I needed a TV to replace the 32&#34; tube TV in my kids room, because I needed a space saver and wanted something safer for my 7 and 5 yr old versus that big TV they had. Upon reading the reviews, I took my chances and bought it. I am more than happy with my purchase and didn&#39;t really need much in a TV except to watch TV, DVDs, and play video games. Had it set up within minutes and was not complicated at all. The picture is fine and the audio is great as well. The one small complaint that I have is that the attachment to the base is a bit wiggly and I feel like it could break if someone puts too much pressure on top of the side of it. Other than that, it serves it purpose! It is lightweight, comes with a remote, has a sleep timer on it, and other basic features. I really like how it swivels, which makes it easy for my kids to adjust it without moving the whole TV. I plan on buying another here soon!! If you are looking for a TV that is simple, basic, and not looking for a whole lot...then this is the TV for you.	2.0	1/19/2012
walmart.com	This TV replaces an old Sharp tv that I&#39;ve had for about 10 years. The Sharp is about the same size screen, but there the similarity ends. The Sharp is so heavy I can&#39;t pick it up or move it. This one is doable. It does have a great picture. You can select your choice of picture styles. The &#34;Normal&#34; is the square style like the old tvs. It leaves a lot of black space around the picture, but it has the best picture because it is close to what is broadcast. The &#34;Wide&#34; style usually fills up the screen. Since it must stretch the picture a bit to fill the screen, it causes a bit of distortion, but I like it best because it is a really big picture. My personal preference. There are other options, like &#34;cinema&#34;, which I have not tried. There are plenty of options for sound too. I had absolutely no trouble hooking up this new tv and getting it going. I have Dish, and as another reviewer mentioned, Sony codes work for setting the Dish remote up for this tv. As others have mentioned the sound is not great. I bought the sound bar to go with this, and now it sounds fabulous! As for price, you can&#39;t beat the price. I paid twice as much for my old tv.	1.0	2/19/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my mother who just moved to a nursing home. She uses wireless headphones to hear the TV and immediately we found that the Samsung TV in her room did not have the audio-out (RJ) jacks needed to connect the headphones. We had just purchased a 50&#34; Spectre TV for our living room and her headphones had plugged in and worked perfectly on the first try, so I simply came back to Walmart.com and ordered this one, a little smaller to fit in her room, but with the same audio-out jacks needed for the headphones. A great value, a great solution for the headphone issue! It&#39;s very hard to find a TV with these additional jacks, so look to Spectre if you&#39;re having the same problem.	Walmart. Save Money.

I could connect it to a sound system, but if their quality control folks gave these speakers a &#34;passed&#34; rating, how confident can I be about the rest of the TV? I took a chance and I lost. This one is going back to Walmart pronto. Bascially you&#39;re flipping a coin if you decide to buy this unit.

I tried everything and even called technical support (after repeated calls going straight to voicemail) but I was unsuccessful. I decided to return both tv&#39;s even though I only had problems with one of them. I never heard of the sceptre brand before so I figured you get what you pay for. I paid an extra 100 bucks and got 2 tv&#39;s that were a better brand. So glad I did!!	1.0	8/28/2014
walmart.com	YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING, JUST READ THE OTHER REVIEWS. FOR SOME PEOPLE THE TV WORKED FINE, BUT FOR OTHERS NOT SO GOOD. I ADMIT, I WAS BEING CHEAP AND AS A RESULT, THE TV STARTED SHOWING A BURY PICTURE AFTER ONE WEEK! I AM ACTUALLY RETURNING THE TV TODAY AND WILL ADD SOME MORE MONEY AND BUY A BETTER WELL KNOWN BRAND. THIS BRAND IS USED OR USE TO BE USED MOSTLY AS COMPUTER MONITORS. I COULDN&#39;T FIND THE TV CODE FOR THIS BRAND TO PROGRAM IT TO MY CABLE REMOTE, HA. OVERALL THE TV IS CHEAP AND APPEARS TO BE A GREAT BUY, BUT I WOULD ADD MORE MONEY AND BUY A BETTER BRAND.	1.0	8/29/2014

walmart.com	I bought this television and when i set it up, was disappointed with the grainy picture quality. After a while I got used to it though as &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34; The sound was also tinny and distant. All of which I could deal with as it was just an extra television for the bedroom. After about three weeks, the picture and sound just stopped working. Thankfully, WalMart has an excellent return policy if within the 90 days. I do not advise wasting your time with this television.	1.0	12/23/2011

I guess I wasnt too suprised when i hooked it up and the picture was green and distorted, the remote was light weight and looked liked a childrens toy, did not give the feeling of qualty in design. I took it back and got an Element brand TV for $10 more and it works great and looks and feels like a quality product. Spend the extra few bucks on an Element. Skip the Spectre brand.	Walmart.

walmart.com	TV lasted approx. 2 months, was working fine except for sound quality. Went to turn it on and the rear of the TV panel flashed then the screen went blank. TV still had power on the LED and there was a burnt smell. Tried to unplug then wait a while but the screen and audio did not work anymore. Brought the walmart service plan thinking I could avoid manufacturer hassles. My mistake, it only takes effect after the manufacturers warranty. Got in touch with Sceptre customer service, they basically said I could just send it back, even though shipping would be covered (I think), I would&#39;ve had to pay extra to insure it along with confirmation. Said forget that and just returned it to the store since it was within the 90 day. Went with the 32&#34; Vizio that was $50 more. MUCH BETTER TV, known quality brand, better audio and picture, TV does not feel as flimsy as the 32&#34; Sceptre LCD. Well worth it, you get what you pay for.	Search	10/30/2012

walmart.com	My overall rating is one star because of their service. I would not purchase this TV. I got this TV in May 2012 and in February 2013 the picture went out. Just a black screen I could only hear sound. I contacted Sceptre, and they issued me a RMA# and a shipping label(that I had to print from my email) and I had to pack up the TV, and take it to my local UPS store and have it shipped. They are based in CA so it took 5days to get there. They so-called replaced the power board and shipped it back to me the day after they got it which took another 5days to get back. I got it back, used it for 2 days, turned it on the 3rd day and was having the SAME ISSUE. I emailed them and did not receive a response back so I called only for them to tell me I must go thru the same process again.(pack, ship, wait) They told me other then this process, there is nothing they can do for me. I reminded them that I already gave them a chance to fix it and they failed so why would I want to trust that they would repair it this time and his response to me was &#34;lets not think that far ahead and assume they wont fix it the 2nd time&#34; I know the price is great but it&#39;s really not worth the hassle of shipping this large TV back and forth to CA. Buy a brand that is known and trusted and stands by good customer service.	5.0	5/10/2012

walmart.com	We bought this TV for parents who finally agreed to replace their fully functional 15-year old CRTs. So, the price was a major consideration; advanced features were *not*. I don&#39;t think you can find a better 32&#34; for $230 (I don&#39;t think you could find *any* 32&#34; for $240; although I am sure there will be something shortly). It has 3 HDMI ports plus VGA, S-Video (for old laptop) and usual composite / Red-White-Yellow stuff (haven&#39;t used it yet). The stand feels a little flimsy (especially when I am turning TV); and the picture is different from 1080p sets - but for the price, it&#39;s a great TV	3.0	9/13/2012

Way out here in the western Pacific, products shipped from the US mainland can take weeks to arrive. This TV came in a week! I highly recommend it.

I&#39;ve never had a Sceptre monitor fail and I&#39;d expect this HDTV to give the same performance. The images on this LCD HDTV surpassed anything I&#39;ve seen and the value was phenomenal. Even at full price there is not another HDTV brand I would ever purchase. To say the least, I am very satisfied with my purchase. It&#39;s light and easy to move on it&#39;s swivel stand. The viewing angle is wide and it&#39;s colors are vibrant. Installation only took an instant.

I got it home, opened it, took the base out it had light scratches on it. I was mad. Then I took the tv out, the screen protecter had scratches and a big cut, 1st thing I thought was the screen was gonna be damaged, I took protecter off suprised it was thick. Screen was fine not a even a tiny scratch, took 3 mins to put screws into base, found out it was a swival base. I was happy. I been wanting a tv with a swival base. Got the cable box n wii hooked up, played with picture settings and looks amazing. I do run my cable with a hdmi cord, (but no hd channels) the sound is so so I can hear it so I can&#39;t complain not cinima quality.

I like the turntable base,too!	4.0	7/15/2011
walmart.com	Sceptre&#39;s are great quality TV&#39;s for their price. I bought my first 32&#34; @ 5 years ago and it is still going strong. Picture and sound quality have not diminished and I am still happy with the purchase.	4.0	7/22/2011

walmart.com	At first I was skeptical about buying a brand that I wasn&#39;t familiar with. But considering that it was only $179 for a 32&#34; I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised at all the features included in this TV - some of which I won&#39;t ever use, like the HDMI and the USB flash drive, but I especially liked the closed caption options and sleep timer features.	1.0	12/7/2011
walmart.com	Purchased this tv for a spare room sight unseen and so far have been very pleased. 1) This TV was shipped in 2 days from CO. to AZ. for the total shipping cost of $2.97 which made my full order including tax $198.44. 2) The shipping was via FedEx and provided tracking and delivery confirmation 3) All descriptions and specs were completely accurate. 4) TV was easy to unpack, add the base, and plug in to start using. 4) Picture and Sound for an extra room were great (this would not be my primary TV, but to each his own) so this fit exactly what I was looking for. 5) I am usually the last person to give a perfect rating, but in this case I have to, I would suggest this TV to anyone.	5.0	12/13/2011

Picture is great, sound (after adjusting the equalizer) is very good &amp; setup was as simple as scanning for channels.

walmart.com	I was concerned that this was not the 1020, so thought the picture might not be as clear as I&#39;d like. I had purchased another tv from another retailer that I returned because I couldn&#39;t hook it up to my older model vcr, got few air channels with my antenna and had a few other complaints. I was unsure of that decision but very happy now that I have purchased this one. I hooked up my VCR and didn&#39;t even have to purchase special cables. Also purchased an inexpensive hdmi cable (about $5) and can now watch movies from my laptop! An inexpensive antennae was hooked up (about $10) and I am getting many air channels. Sound and picture are great and I really like the swivel base that the other TV didn&#39;t have. All I want to add now is a bluray wi fi dvd player to play my dvds and watch netflix movies! Very pleased with this purchase and it is much better than the more expensive TV I returned because I just wasn&#39;t ahppy with it. I purchased the antenna, hdmi cable, and can purchase a highly rated bluray player for the same price of the TV I returned. Excellent value so far! Features got a 4 star because when I request info, I don&#39;t get the program name. Does everything else!	Toggle Search	5/3/2012

walmart.com	I ordered this item online for $149, though I&#39;d never heard of the brand. It was the cheapest 32&#34; TV I could find after Black Friday. (By the way, I also purchased a Hisense 32&#34; TV in-store at Walmart, about 10 days later, for the same price. Had never heard of that brand, either.) It was delivered free to the store nearest my house within a day or two of ordering. Very quick. It was simple to add the plastic base onto the bottom. Took about 20 minutes to read the instructions and finish it. It has a beautiful picture. I connected my Roku (for Netflix and Amazon Prime), a DVD player, and a digital antenna for local TV. I&#39;ve been using it for about 10 days, and all are working perfectly. The TV is replacing a 32&#34; LG that I bought more than five years ago (I recently gave it to my son). 32&#34; TVs have gone down in price nearly 70 percent since 2009. I paid $400 for the LG at Walmart in October 2009, and these were both $150 in December 2014. Also, the LG is an LCD screen, and these are both LEDs, 720p. Good buy, well worth the money. Get yourself one. Because you deserve it.	Invalid city, state or zip code	11/23/2012

I did not want to spend a lot of money for a tv that is rarely used, but now that I have had it in operation, I may buy another one for our bedroom in our primary home. There have been no issues. Good sound, picture, and a remote that is very easy to navigate. Not a lot of frills, but I got to tell you the simple nature of this tv is refreshing. This tv is a great value and I am very happy with it. Feel the need to spend a couple hundred more on a name brand, go ahead and waste your money.	5.0	9/19/2013

walmart.com	I am 14 years old and I know what you all are thinking...&#34;Why should I listen to him&#34;. But I do a lot of research into things. I was looking for a new TV that I could buy with my Christmas money. So I looked through a lot of sites such as Amazon, Walmart, Google shopping, ect... So I found this on sale for 209. I was fairly excited because I was upgrading from a 19 inch Sanyo HDTV to a 32inch Sceptre. So I got my money together and got my dad he said it looked like a good deal but we should more because we&#39;ve never heard of Sceptre. So i did more research and found it was worth the buy. So we couldn&#39;t find any other TV to match the price and size. So i bought the HDTV it was a great buy for that low of a price, Great shipping it said anytime from 12\29-1\4 and i ordered it on the 27th and got it on the 29th! This is a great buy but from my view the sound wasn&#39;t even all that good but it&#39;s decent something i can work with and everything else is pretty good! But if you have extra money I would suggest if you get it a 2 year warranty with it, Or a Sanyo, LG, Sony in the same size. Hope this helps!	5.0	1/9/2014

The sound quality is not great -- but we hooked it up to an old stereo on Auxiliary, and the sound is terrific. We have had no major problems with this TV at all -- very rarely I (like once a month or less) the sound cuts off suddenly. All it takes is turning it on and off to restore it. It&#39;s so infrequent that it&#39;s not an issue, especially considering the price. I recommend this TV to anyone with a small TV budget... but do hook it up to better speakers.	Walmart. Save Money.

walmart.com	This TV seems to compare favorably with the other brands in the size and somewhat higher price range. I&#39;m not altogether pleased with the sound quality and there&#39;s no tone control. This is helped by connecting powered speakers with controls. I did find the stand wobbly, as others have noted, but putting desktop size speakers under each side helped to stabilize the screen. The picture quality at 720p seems impressive for its size, though with LED, some of the warmth from CRTs seems to be lacking. One gets used it, hopefully, and after a week, I don&#39;t notice it so much. There are controls for brightening and changing the temperature which I&#39;ll try. The picture when watching DVDs has problems to some extent. There&#39;s fringing sometimes around the image edges, and some images within the picture tend to blur together in a not very prerry mass...like a video game without enough RAM, I think. One of the reasons we got this thing was to watch the vast collection of YouTube videos when we connect our iPad mini to the set via a VGA cable. We could also have the HDMI cable, but it costs more. Someone said the definition is better with that, but I&#39;m more than satisfied, and the VGA lets me connect the &#39;pad to the projector if I need a really large presentation.	5.0	11/26/2014

walmart.com	Factoring in the price, this is an average TV. Picture quality is acceptable, but audio at higher volumes breaks up (very cheap speakers used in this set).

walmart.com	Okay for a small room, or if you have speakers already. The built-in speakers are cheap and tinny sounding. The bass rattles. Cannot turn the volume up too far.

walmart.com	I have a lot of issues with this t.v. Bought it for under $200 and it is not under priced (32 inch). Picture is just OK and sound is hollow.

There is a delay when using and pushing the remote control buttons and I have to push several times to get it to change to whatever.

walmart.com	Had the same size and price unit with a different name brand. Both had same problem. Brightness of screen drops sometimes (flicker). Major difference between these two almost similar units (might come from same production line) however is the audio. Spectre&#39;s audio has no body, it is like listening through a tube. Adjusting the audio has not effect. Specifically it is like power a speaker without the benefit of an enclosure. Otherwise, you get what you paid for, which in my case, fits.	4.0	6/23/2011

walmart.com	Backlight went out after almost 3 months. TV got Medium to Heavy use. Taking back to Wal-Mart. Other than that this was a average unit, on par with its price. The stand was scatched when we opened the package and the box itself looked as if UPS/FEDEX was just tossing it around.	Items in cart	12/24/2011
walmart.com	I purchased this HDTV in June of 2012 for use in the bedroom. As a result it sees limited use compared with the primary TV in the family room. The picture quality was good for the sale price of $189 but it&#39;s not even close to the Sony Bravia 32&#34; in our lounge. The image is not as bright, vivid or crisp as the Sony, but for less than have the price, the image was very good in it&#39;s use as a secondary TV. The sound quality was average with no real bass and no real ability to handle movie sounds or music with great success. But it does work well in it&#39;s role as a bedroom unit playing primarily standard television programing. Unfortunately after only 10 months of service our unit has failed. During a recent power up the image shut off and only the sound remains. A strong odor of burnt electronics accompanied the failure. Sceptre requires that I ship the unit to them for warranty service and in either the original packaging (now gone) or request an approved package. I am required to pay shipping in either case. At a minimum this will be time consuming and cost between 10% and 15% of the original purchase price. Consider these potential future costs when opting for this price point model.

walmart.com	TV was very cheaply made. The speakers were very tinny and rattled whenever there was any bass on the show. Then it started to turn off all by itself. So I returned it at exchanged it for a Sony 32 inch which is a fabulous set.	Invalid city, state or zip code	12/31/2011
walmart.com	When I first got it, it worked great. The picture and sound are great and the features are good as well. After having it for only two weeks, it went out. All I got was a blue screen that said no signal. I spent three weeks sending emails to tech support trying to get it fixed. They&#39;re only open until 5:30pm pacific time, so if you work for a living you&#39;re not going to get in touch with them easily. Finally, got it fixed, it turned out to be something simple. A month later, guess what, it did the same thing again. Everything that they told me to try last time, I have already tried and nothing is working. This TV is not worth your money. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to family or friends or even somebody that I don&#39;t know. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to someone that I don&#39;t like. Nobody deserves this headache. Do yourself a favor and get something better.	4.0	1/20/2012

walmart.com	When I first received my tv, I was thrilled. The picture was great, the sound was great, I even bought a wall mount for it. I had no problems at all with this tv for 2 months, and then the picture went out on it. The &#39;Sceptre&#39; splash screen would come on when you first powered up the tv, but then the whole screen would just go black and you couldn&#39;t access any of the menus, change the channel- nothing. I would not recommend this tv to anyone unless you don&#39;t have a problem replacing the whole tv every 2 months because customer support is useless. Do Not Buy This TV!!!!	2.0	12/4/2012

walmart.com	Not really a fair review because there was a thin red line running across the screen on all channels. I was unable to fix it so I returned the set to Walmart 2 days after I bought it. They gave me a no hassle return of my money - and I went to the back of the store and bought a Magnovox 32 inch TV. It was $40 more than the Sceptre but so far is runnibg great.	1.0	11/21/2013
walmart.com	The TV set itself was great - wonderful picture, sound, easy to set up. However, the remote control stopped working one day after the purchase. I bought an RCA universal remote control, programmed it and worked for one day. Then I bought another universal control which was supposed to support the Sceptre brand but it would not work. I called the Sceptre 800 number. They were very helpful and mailed me another remote control but it did not work. I finally returned the TV and ordered a well known brand. I&#39;m not sure if I was just unlucky to get a TV that had a glitch.	1.0	11/24/2013

Returned the TV and paid to get the in-laws a Samsung TV and have not looked at Sceptre again. My wife called customer service when the TV died and customer service at Sceptre was rude and treated my wife like she was an idiot and said he could do nothing for her.

walmart.com	This turned out to be a nice little TV. It&#39;s bigger than I had anticipated. I didn&#39;t realize how big a 32&#34; TV would be! Set up was simple, and it&#39;s really easy to operate. It DOES come with a remote! I only had two problems. First of all, since it is a flat-screen TV, it doesn&#39;t do well in small rooms. Unless you are at least 4 - 5 feet from the screen, it&#39;s a little fuzzy. Once I moved it to another room where there&#39;s a lot more distance between me and the TV, the picture was great. My biggest problem with this TV is the sound quality. Our old &#34;tube&#34; TV with stereo speakers built in had way better sound quality. This TV sounds like it only has one speaker. Luckily, I had a set of Logitech speakers with a woofer that I connected and now it sounds great and looks great.	1.0	8/23/2012

walmart.com	Bought this, set it up and right out the box the sound quality drove me crazy. It sounded like I had bought something out of the toy section instead of the electronic section. Tv pics/quality changed from channel to channel, quite iritating. Picture took too long to come in once you pushed the button to change channels. The only thing I liked was the convenient swivel base. Save your money and invest in a more competitive brand. You get what you pay for and that&#39;s why I took it back about three days later.	4.0	10/11/2012

walmart.com	I bought mine a little over a year ago and a gray patch developed, then it took longer and longer to turn on. Apparently, upon researching this, this is a very common problem with this tv. While the price is appealing, it doesn&#39;t last long, and I ended up buying a better, 32 inch Sony for my bedroom, and Iike that the bezel(frame) on my new one is only about a 1/2 inch. You might have better luck then I did, but if I knew then what I know now, I would not buy this tv.	5.0	11/27/2012

The low price is not indicative of low quality. Picture is great and does very well with a home theatre surround sound set up. It is easy to use for online movies, for Playstation 3 DVD &amp; Gaming use. I ordered and got it right away, set it up, plugged stuff in, and was off and enjoying!!!

I&#39;ve had it a month now and couldn&#39;t be more enthusiastic about this set. Great clear picture, good sound, and I can see the baseball stats on the screen without squinting. It swivels so easily so I can see it from all angles...the remote is easy. My only suggestion for improvement would be that the sleep timer font size on the screen should be larger...I had to learn to touch the timer a certain number of times since I couldn;t see it unless I was just a few feet away. Given all the pros, it&#39;s easy to put up with only 1 con.	5.0	3/26/2013

I liked the original remote because it was simple and very easy to use.	5.0	4/10/2013
walmart.com	We purchased this TV to put outside on our screened-in porch. This TV is a great value for the price, with outstanding picture quality. At this low price, we figure if it lasts a couple of years, we got our money&#39;s worth---compared to the thousands it would have cost for an outdoor-rated TV.	Menu	4/27/2013
walmart.com	fully met my expectations, provided an audio output so I could send the signal via fm transmitter to my hearing aids. Not many units in this price range provide this feature. Sound control in going between different channels and/or loud commercials can only be described as weak. but for the price I would buy another unit. Only had for a short while so time will tell on reliability. Response time with email questions and telephone calls were within reason ( had to leave a message and receive a call back) and questions answered well. Could not get to real live person tho, only via call back. Gave it a five star because we can adjust to sound issue.	Toggle Search	5/10/2013

walmart.com	I ordered this TV on a Tuesday afternoon. Walmart said that it would be delivered between that Thursday or following Monday (with Expedited Shipping). It arrived Thursday morning. I was thrilled! I set it up Thursday night. The setup was extremely easy. The instructions were easy to follow and I love that a small screwdriver was included in the box (along with batteries for the remote control). Once it was setup, I started playing with the settings. There are several Aspect ratios to choose from: Normal, Cinema and Wide. There are several color &#34;tones&#34; to choose from &#34;Normal, Warm, Cool.&#34; You don&#39;t have to change any of these if you don&#39;t want to, I just like to fully check things out and see what they can do. The picture quality is really good, as is the sound. I do have to say that this is the first TV I&#39;ve ever purchased for myself. Every TV I&#39;ve had previously were hand-me-downs. I spent about 2 months researching my options before choosing this TV. I knew I wanted a 32&#34; flat-panel screen with 720p, among other things. This TV met all my requirements and was cheaper than what I could find at Sears, Best Buy, Walmart (in Store), or even Amazon. I was shocked! I have always been able to find whatever I needed cheaper at Amazon but not this time. As I stated earlier. I am very happy with my purchase.	5.0	3/30/2012

(I cannot remember what bells this TV has as we will probably never do more than watch TV on it.) This is a great 32&#34; flat screen TV for the money which is why I gave it an excellent rating. Less bass in the sound is important to us and we were able to adjust the sound easily. The first week we were a little disappointed in the picture quality as it was not very sharp.

walmart.com	I recently purchased this Sceptre 32 inch tv and within 4 days it was delivered to my door with free shipping. The initial setup was easy and within a few minutes a had scanned the cable for channels and the tv was operational. The tv has options to set the color, tint, and sound to your individual taste as well as many other options and after making a few minor changes I was well pleased with the picture quality. The picture is as good if not better than my $550 42 inch HD tv and at less than half the price. This tv is in our bedroom and since it is in the corner of the room the swivel base is a handy feature. As far as durability goes I have no idea as to that aspect but I would recommend the Sceptre based on picture quality and price.	5.0	11/12/2014
walmart.com	Very Good Panel with great color,sharpness and viewing angle. Looks fantastic running 1080. Th sound from the stock speakers is not all that good but when hooked to any other speakers is excellent. Plenty of jacks for home theater,hdmi,etc. This tv even plays MP3 music and JPEG photos from a flashdrive. I bought this as a Christmas gift so I tried it out first to make sure it was ok and I decided to keep it and I ordered another Sceptre 32&#34; as the gift. I would say for the price this tv may be the best deal on the market. I am very impressed with it and did buy two.	5.0	12/12/2014

I use a Roku streaming video player or a DVD player for viewing movies. With this ez set up, I have something interesting to view at any time at a very reasonable price.

I read everyone else&#39;s reviews prior to purchasing, and they were pretty spot on, it&#39;s a great tv! Our living room is on the cozier side and the 32&#34; size was absolutely perfect for it. If you are looking for a good tv, and not looking to spend a fortune, while the name is less known, this is a great one! The sound was a little off after initial set up, but we believe that&#39;s because of where we had it set up with the sound bouncing off of our wall. With readjusting our placement the sound issue was cured!	5.0	7/16/2011

walmart.com	I purchased the Sceptre 32&#34; HDTV a few days ago online, and received it a few hours ago. I paid less for this than I did for my last 28&#34; 4:3 HDTV just about three years ago. When that one gave up the ghost, I chose this one based on the number of five and four star ratings other owners gave it. In my case at least their advice is appreciated. There are better TVs on the market, with more features, but I&#39;d be hard pressed to justify a more expensive TV. Yes, this is just 720 lines of resolution instead of 1080, but I think unless you were looking at the TV with a microscope few would be able to tell the difference. Sitting across the room watching a program on a 32&#34; TV you would need eyes like an eagle to see a difference. In fact the Sceptre has a few features than nothing else even close to its price can claim. The only less expensive HDTVs were all smaller than 32&#34; and none as far as I saw had more than one HDMI port. The Scepter 32&#34; has three. A few around its price might have a USB port, but of those that do, that usually was only for firmware upgrades. The Scepter&#39;s USB port can be used for firmware upgrades, but it also enables the TV to play MP3 files, and show jpeg photos. The TV also boasts 1/8&#34; stereo phone plug for headphones, RCA phono plugs for A/V devices (like the Wii), a VGA connector to allow it to be used as a computer monitor, audio out RCA phono plugs for use with stereo equipment (like a home entertainment system), and RCA phono plugs for YPbPr (used by some systems to send separated color channel information for video). Setting up the Sceptre was a snap. It weighs only about 15 pounds, so it is easy to lift and move around. I had to attach the base with four Philips head screws which were provided. The package included a little Philips head screwdriver for that! Then I connected the monitor to my cable box with an HDMI cord, which I had to purchase extra. And finally I plugged the detachable power cord into the TV and the wall, and I was ready to go. The onscreen menu makes it easy to configure. I won&#39;t use my TV&#39;s tuner, but that&#39;s easy to set up as well. You would need to attach a cable or antenna, and then allow the TV to find channels the first time you start it up. In my case I only needed to select HDMI as the source for my A/V, set the clock, and find a suitable aspect ratio for the programs that I watch. All of that is easily done using the TV&#39;s remote. My DVR remote was easy to reprogram for the TV by selecting the first Sony HDTV number listed by my DVR. I&#39;ve never had HDTV without a cable connection, so I cannot say how it would be on an antenna. I know that you need a strong signal from your TV stations to drive the HD circuitry, so if you are out in the country without cable or Dish TV, this might not be the TV for you. Most, however, will be pleased with this TV if they are looking for a new TV that won&#39;t break the bank.	5.0	8/22/2011
walmart.com	After a great amount of research I chose this product because of price, features, size and the incredible WALMART.COM performance and reputation. I have never had a bad experience with them. For all those commentators who want to act like expert technophobes and criticize every little thing... let me say that this product is exceptionally good with a tremendous price point and it is absolutely the best purchase experience I have ever had with WALMART. Out of the box and fully programmed and hooked up to my stereo, Roku, DVD and very small interior antenna in less than 15 minutes. Description and specifications are dead-on! Yes, the speakers are bit weeney but since I don&#39;t use them it was not an issue. The picture quality is wonderful and I have zero problems picking up 23 channels which are about 12-15 miles away. Features and functions are abundant. Ordered, received and installed in 4 days using free store pick-up. This is the best purchase with 100% satisfaction I have made in years. I only wish I had room for a 2nd one!	5.0	8/22/2011

walmart.com	Expected to find something to be unhappy about considering the low price, but was surprised by the quality. Sure, not a feature rich high end big name model, but the picture, sound and remote are very adequate. It uses the Sony codes for the remote but does that mean it shares the technology or components, I don&#39;t know? I have 3 other flat screens from name brand companies and this compares well, especially the speakers. You can never expect a home theater sound quality from such a limited space and in this case a small price. The base is a little light weight, so be careful it will not be in an area where it can get bumped.	5.0	9/7/2011
walmart.com	I purchased this television on sale for a guest bedroom in our home -- it was an excellent purchase!! The set has a wonderful picture and great sound!!! It came with a small stand, remote control and av cables for DVD player hook-up. I also purchased the 3-year service contract. The set is light weight, very thin and perfect for almost anywhere in our house. Also, small enough and light weight enough to take on our road trips. Our son is currently staying with us and has been watching the set daily for the last month and has enjoyed it problem-free. I would highly recommend this set to anyone.	5.0	9/26/2011

The sound is better than we thought based on reveiws. Bottom line, if you want to use this for a home theater, you will need to make sure you have a digital signal and a good stereo. If that does not matter to you, this TV is great option.	5.0	10/7/2011

walmart.com	This television was purchased because of it&#39;s low price and LED feature. The picture quality is far superior to our other LCD televisions as well as our plasma television.

walmart.com	To tell the truth, I was little nervous to buy a no name brand LCD TV. But the price was so great, I went ahead. Surprisingly, the whole box was much lighter than my expectations when I picked it up from Walmart store. I bought it as a replacement to my basement TV. I connected a small antenna and was able to get about 15 local channels and the picture was surprisingly very crisp. Within no time, I hooked my WI and DVD player with it. It has several HDMI ports which provide the clearest picture. For my WI I bought a special cable with 5 wires on ebay for 3.99$. That made the WI games much sharper. I even connected my extra PC computer to the TV and was able to use it as monitor as well. Though, I also managed to get internet channel through my WI as well. The only pros is the remote control which acts little moody at times. But so far I am very happy with the purchase.	Items in cart	11/19/2011
walmart.com	This 32&#34; flat screen was purchased as a surprise gift for an elderly lady (89 yrs. old). She still had a 25&#34; set that was probably 20 years old. The picture quality is like night and day since her eyesight is failing as well. She wept when she received this gift and she absolutely loves her new tv!!!!! It was an exceptional value for the $$. Her television viewing is pretty much her whole life as she does not drive anymore. I know one lady who is very happy with this purchase. I would recommend this flat screen very highly. A lot of bang for the buck!	Enter city, state or zip code	11/21/2011
walmart.com	I bought this T.V. to replace the very old (and boring) analog 19&#34; Sony CRT Television in my family room. Even though my expectations were not very high to begin with, because it doesn&#39;t take much to beat a 19&#34; analog CRT TV, I was still pleasantly surprised by the features offered by this inexpensive TV. It has numerous inputs and even offers left and right audio outputs. The picture quality is sharp and clear. I probably could have spent a lot more money and gotten something that was name brand (and may or may not have had a few more features) but I personally am more than pleased with this purchase. It is a shame they don&#39;t carry this item &#34;in store&#34; but &#34;sight to store&#34; only took two or three days so I can&#39;t complain. Overall I would say that if you are looking for a 32&#34; LCD T.V., with a number of very good features, for a price that is more than fair, you need not look any farther.

walmart.com	This is a great tv! I&#39;m a Directv technician and I&#39;m in contact with about 12 different tv&#39;s on any given day. I feel that qualifies me as an expert of sorts ;) But honestly, I have seen many 32 inch sets from sony to samsung, even the cheapies like vizio and apex. The picture on this set is great in comparison to any of these. Samsung being the best in my opinon, but this is a close second. The sound isnt great which you should expect with any flat panel television. There really is no where to impliment great sound on sets this thin. A cheap surrond sound system should do. On a side note, I did hook this up to a Directv HD receiver. So if you have basic service dont expect to see the TV&#39;s true potential.	5.0	12/8/2011

walmart.com	I did so much &#39;reviewing&#39; before ordering this TV. I am not the kind of person who is technilogically smart....so I read tons of reviews. End result was that I ordered the TV because the price was one of the best I&#39;ve seen. Now that I have it...(2 weeks) I am sooo thrilled with it. I went thru the book, thru the OSD&#39;s and can&#39;t believe that I was able to work thru the whole thing. The sound is better than my 32&#34; LG and the picture is great...except that I still have to get a tiny bit more of the OSD lined up. I just love this TV and if I find another one with a great price I am going to get that one too for my spare bedroom. (guests will be absolutely thrilled!!)	4.0	1/23/2012
walmart.com	I bought this TV as a Mothers Day gift for my mom online and then had it shipped to the store for free. She loves the TV. It took a few minutes to hook it up to the cable and DVD player she currently has. It has a great picture and really good sound. You can hear the TV even when it&#39;s on volume 14 in the next room quite clearly. I think it&#39;s a great TV for the price I paid online. Even though, I had never heard of Sceptre before buying this TV. I will definitely check them out to see if they make anything else.	4.0	1/23/2012

walmart.com	My husband and I purchased this TV for our daughters bedroom, and the picture is great, the sound is a little rubbley, if you blast it, but I just adjusted the sound and lowered the Bass, and it&#39;s perfff! I would recommend this TV for a bedroom, or if you are replacing a boob-tube in the kids room like I was then you can&#39;t go wrong with a price like this!	4.0	1/24/2012
walmart.com	This is my first flatscreen TV, but it seems to be excellent, especially considering the $189 price including free shipping to my home. Ordered it on the 4th of July and it arrived on Saturday the 7th, can&#39;t do much better than that! Took a little fiddling to get the picture adjusted to my liking. The sound adjustment was one of a couple of different choices and sounds as good as any TV without additional speakers. I had to buy an HDMI cable to connect my blu-ray, you&#39;d think they would come with an HDMI cable since there is no other way to use the device, but it&#39;s not a big deal. I would recommend this TV to anyone and am considering a larger Sceptre for the livingroom. I read on someone&#39;s review that these are made at the same plant that makes the much higher priced Sony models. The quality on this set seems to be very good, so that may be the reason.

walmart.com	my overall review with this product was exceptional. the price was great, the tv itself is an amazing product, very simple to program, very simple to operate, everything was included, batteries, remote,directions. it even came with a screwdriver.. i was very impressed. one of the better electronic purchases i&#39;ve made in a long time....you won&#39;t be dissapointed if you purchase this product..	Toggle Search	1/27/2012
walmart.com	I was apprehensive about purchasing a brand name I was not familiar with. This TV blew me away since it is $100 less expensive than the same size and specs as my Vizio that I also love. I was a bit concerned about being able to program my Direct TV remote to the TV, but Direct does have a code for it. As it turns out, the remote worked perfectly without reprogramming it. The remote was previously programmed to a Sony and I didn&#39;t have to change anything. Easy set up and I love the swivel base. I have 2 Sylvania sets of the same size and neither one of them have ever been able to program to the Direct TV or the Dish Network remote.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/31/2012
walmart.com	I bought this TV, even after reading some of the terrible reviews here, and am not disappointed so far. I&#39;ve known of Sceptre from years of computer use and know that their monitors are great quality, so figured that they probably did a good job transitioning to TV&#39;s as well. Of course for under $200 I didn&#39;t expect to get high def picture quality or Dolby sound, but wasn&#39;t looking for that. I just wanted a larger TV for my living room. The picture quality actually is pretty good, with vivid and accurate color although a bit pixilated if you get up real close, and the set up is a breeze. Sound does leave a bit to be desired though, so for those who enjoy the full, rich sound of the theater, I would recommend an add-on sound system. I also enjoyed the fact that this set is VERY light, making it easy to place where ever you want it. I also like the remote that comes with this set! Very easy to understand and use, unlike the one that came with my last TV. I also wanted to comment about some of the reviews here that stated that customer service was impossible (or nearly) to reach on the phone. I decided to call the customer service number listed in the online documentation prior to receiving my TV to ask a few questions relating to other posts I had read here. I was pleasantly surprised when a very polite, friendly and professional customer service rep answered the phone on the first ring and proceeded to answer all of my questions quickly, thoroughly and professionally. Guess this just goes to show that you can&#39;t believe everything that you read. :-) Glad I took the chance and ordered this TV. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a mid-sized TV without spending a lot of money. Good product!	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/31/2012

The one issue I do have is that there&#39;s only one set of &#34;red, white, and yellow&#34; plug holes. In turn I have to get an HDMI cable to have my TV working with my DVD player and PS2 at the same time. Other than that, it&#39;s wonderful!	Enter city, state or zip code	3/17/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this tv a year ago. It runs on most days over 10 hours. We have had no issues with picture or sound.

walmart.com	I finally got around to upgrading from my old CRT TV with this set and I couldn&#39;t be more satisfied. Being used to the old standard definition set it is hard for me to judge for sure just how much of the picture quality improvement is due to now having HD but I can say the picture quality is excellent, colors are crisp and true and the overall quality is great. While the sound quality is very good I do plan to add either a sound bar or external surround sound system in the future, it is really not a matter of necessity but with the great picture I want the full effect of a matching sound system. I don&#39;t think you can beat the value of this TV, I am on a limited budget and found it very affordable.	1.0	11/14/2012
walmart.com	Sceptre is the best flat screen TV I have ever purchased. Normally I purchase Visio but from now on my flat screens will be Sceptre&#39;s! Flat screens are not known for their reliability but I have insurance through my cable TV operator that replaces failed equipment at no cost. I have had one of my Visio&#39;s fail. I&#39;ll have to wait on the Sceptre to prove itself. However, my guess is it will last a long time.	1.0	11/20/2012

walmart.com	Before buying this TV online I read most of the reviews. Some were positive, some not so much. But I have to say I am very, very pleased with my TV. It is exactly as described in the details. Some were complaining about the sound and I was expecting to have to buy a speaker system for it. I have no problem with the sound.The price is great and so far, so good with everything else. I&#39;ve had it for about 4 or 5 weeks now and it has played almost 24-7and I can&#39;t complain about anything at this point, and Lord I hope it stays that way.	1.0	11/21/2012

walmart.com	This is my impression of the Sceptre X322BV 32&#34; 720 led LCD. I can&#39;t see anything bad about this TV. The broadcast reception is excellent, the picture is excellent - good color/ contrast right out of the box!, the USB slideshow is excellent. If you just watch, not live for TV, then this is a fine product. It&#39;s only 720p, but broadcasters in my area don&#39;t sent out more than 1080i, so not a problem. The viewing angle is nearly equal to my samsung plasma. I like the picture/ color temp/ tons more than my Viore led LCD 1080 TV (always trying to tweak it). Only had this a few weeks, but so far it is amazing. The speakers are average for this type of TV - but with analog &#34;RCA&#34; jacks, a 3.5mm jack, &amp; 3 HDMI ports you can plug into just about anything. Can not play video files thru USB - like my samsung - but I knew that before purchase. I seem to recall reading that there are only 2 or 3 actual manufacturers of LCD screens and everybody slaps their guts into the same screens. I can not rate features because I don&#39;t &#34;live&#34; for TV - or gaming, so I may not be familiar with all, or lack of, features.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	12/12/2012

When I hooked it up to my laptop to use as a 2nd screen, which works great, but when I watched a show with the hdmi cable the sound had to be turned up all the way and still was not loud enough. It is better when connected to the cable for tv. Overall, I am still very pleased with it for the value and cost.	1.0	5/13/2014

I tried my PC with this TV to a resolution of 2560 by 1080 at 75 HZ and got excellent results. This high of resolutions was not listed in the manual but it did work. If you have a computer connected to the TV, try the highest resolution and see what happens. Won&#39;t hurt.	1.0	5/20/2014

walmart.com	I wanted a tv for my bedroom that was large enough to see without my contacts but that wasn&#39;t too pricey as I would only be watching it right before bed. The reviews on this one was great so I went for it. The quality of the picture is much better than my daughter&#39;s 32&#34; RCA brand tv in her playroom. I spent almost double for it last year than I did on this one. She prefers to watch tv in my room as opposed to her playroom now.	5.0	5/21/2014
walmart.com	I may be rushing this review since I just set up this TV last night, but so far, I love it! It has a beautiful picture and the manual is very easy to understand as are the instructions for putting the TV on the stand. In fact, this TV comes with everything you need, including a magnetic screw driver, to put it together. I&#39;ve looked everywhere, including online stores that sell refurbished or even used TVs, and no one beats this price. I purchased it for a guest bedroom so I won&#39;t be watching it a lot, but even a smaller TV cost more elsewhere, so I bought the 32&#34;. I have always paid attention to the reviews and this TV got great reviews. Gotta love Walmart!	5.0	5/21/2014

This TV is even better since its been updated with a super slim brushed metal bezel. Great picture quality at 32&#34; though I would recommend 1080p for TV&#39;s larger than this. Consider purchasing the Sceptre Sound Bar to improve sound quality but really OK with standard speakers. Walmart had the best price online and I felt secure purchasing from them.

walmart.com	This is my second Sceptre television. I have yet to have any issues with either set. For the price you pay you get a set with excellent picture quality and all the connections you&#39;ll need to make a great entertainment system. The only knock against the set is the location of the speakers, back bottom, which makes it necessary to turn the volume a little higher than normal to hear it. All in all, a really good television at a very good price.	4.0	8/26/2014

walmart.com	installation was ridiculously easy, picture quality was great, although it didn&#39;t specify surround sound it would have been nice, great bargain	5.0	9/1/2014
walmart.com	For a 32&#34; TV and considering its price the set seems to perform well. At (only) 32&#34; it probably won&#39;t be your primary TV in a living room, so it&#39;s being evaluated mostly as a nice sized set in a bedroom. For a main entertainment set, you&#39;d probably want to look a few size classes up anyway. 40&#34; sets have come down so much in price anyway. The 720 vs 1080 distinction doesn&#39;t seem to make a substantial difference looking at this set from across the bedroom. The quality is good with an HD signal. If you&#39;re replacing a non-HD set with this one (as I did) expect to notice a bit of fuzziness with non-HD input. Any &#34;upscaling&#34; this unit may try to do doesn&#39;t seem to work as well as it does by our main television. The sound quality is quite poor, but that&#39;s a common gripe with flat screen sets. Regardless, it&#39;s noticeably worse than our other TVs. I mitigated this by hooking it up through the iPhone dock next to this TV. Still, at the price it was purchased, a decent sound bar could still be acquired and come out ahead on both money and quality. All things considered it&#39;s a good set, and a perfect size for a bedroom. Not too big as to be blinding at night, but big enough to see clearly across a room.	5.0	9/1/2014
walmart.com	We love this TV. It has a really good picture and the color is bright. I read some of the reviews before the purchase and most were right on the money. If, this is an additional television for your home (video games, computer, etc.) this will be a great buy. The sound quality is not good but, that is the only drawback with this purchase.	5.0	9/16/2014

The picture is a bit grainy of you are real close to the screen, but I have a large living room so picture quality is not a problem for me. Sound could be a bit better, but it is pretty decent as well. For the price, this is a very serviceable television set. I am quite pleased with the purchase.	5.0	10/1/2014
walmart.com	The only thing I don&#39;t like about this tv is the sound. We have hooked up our surround sound to it so it worked out fine for us but if you don&#39;t have that the sound quality is not the best. Good for a kids room.	5.0	10/7/2014

walmart.com	I helped my 11 year old son search for his first LCD TV and this Sceptre 32&#34; met his wants and needs. Overall this LCD is a great product. Picture quality was great right out of the box, no dead pixels, features easy to use, and at an excellent price. I gave the TV 4 stars because the stand could be more stable. It will sway if you force it, but if sitting stationary the stand holds the TV with no problems. The speakers are not the greatest, but are not bad and do the job. My son loves his new TV and loves playing Xbox360 on it. I am now thinking about purchasing a larger Sceptre for myself. All in all I would recommend this TV for anyone looking for a quality product on a budget.	5.0	10/20/2014

walmart.com	First off the important thing: The picture is great! When using an HDMI connection and an HD channel, it has a fantastic picture. For the less positive: The sound can get rattly when turned up. We use a sound system so don&#39;t notice that so much. I hooked HDMI up to the #2 connector on the back of the TV and had all kinds of trouble with pixillated channels and sound not staying with the picture. When I switched to the #1 HDMI, everything worked fine. So I don&#39;t know what the issue is with that port. This is an excellent value at $249.	5.0	11/1/2014

walmart.com	This TV is decent. The picture quality is ok, sound is a bit lacking, and the remote feels cheap. The reason I rate this TV high is that it is impossible to find a 32&#34; at this price. I wouldn&#39;t make this the main TV for a home theater, but for the bedroom or a dorm room, this TV is perfect. If it blows up in 2 years, i wouldn&#39;t cry too much. The picture quality shall not be compared to mid-level Samsung, LG, Sony, etc. As long as you are not used to seeing top quality HDTV, the picture will be ok. Sound has no depth or bass. It feels like listening to a cheap pair of computer speakers. HDMI input works fine with my Hannspree laptop, the screen resolution and refreshing rate is recognized immediately. The set looks good and is steady. I&#39;ve had it for a month with no problems...	5.0	11/9/2014

We checked the TV out at the store and the screen did not seem to be cracked. So far the TV is working okay, just have my fingers crossed that the uncaring truck driver did not ruin something internal. So I would rate this product good and Walmart&#39;s site to store drivers poor.	4.0	11/30/2014

walmart.com	Just like most other&#39;s reviews I would say the only flaw is the feedback you get from the speakers.

I actually first bought a Samsung and returned it for this one bc I wasn&#39;t impressed with the picture quality for the price I paid.

When we updated our programming to the hd package the screen quality was MUCH better. I remember reading about the sound quality being poor and it isn&#39;t exceptional, but it isn&#39;t awful either. It seems like the sound quality improves when we watch HD channels. Eventually we&#39;ll probably get a speaker system but it isn&#39;t really necessary if you aren&#39;t all that picky. Overall we&#39;re happy with the purchase.	5.0	1/2/2015

The sound quality is not as good and sounds tinny but is suitable for my bedroom. I don&#39;t expect sound quality on flat screens to be that great because of how the speakers have to be on flat screens. I had a similar issue with my 42in rca plasma and the sound. Overall, for the price, which was great, its a good fit for me!	5.0	1/3/2015

Only two real cons are first, the sound quality is a bit lacking - it&#39;s fine for my purposes (the occasional football game or sitcom), but if you&#39;re an audio buff you are definitely going to need a speaker set up. Second, the casing is a bit flimsy - it&#39;s very lightweight plastic, and doesn&#39;t feel real solid or stable. That being said it is still a good, cheap alternative if you want a large LCD screen without a large sticker price.	5.0	1/3/2015
walmart.com	I purchased this item for Christmas for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! she thanked me over and over again.	5.0	1/3/2015
walmart.com	This TV was an early Christmas gift from my parents to be placed in my bedroom. They told me to get online and find myself an affordable 32 inch TV. I found this one and was skeptical at first because I had never heard of the brand, but the price was awesome. I figured it was only going in the bedroom so an unfamiliar, greatly priced TV would be fine. It arrived way earlier than it was suppose to and we have been very satisfied with it. I LOVE the fact that it swivels on it&#39;s stand. It&#39;s very convenient for me when I&#39;m laying in bed watching it. I can just tilt it in my direction without having to move the stand. The picture quality is great. The sound quality is good but there&#39;s normally no in between with it. It always seems that it is either too loud or too low, haven&#39;t found the perfect sound setting yet.	5.0	1/4/2015

walmart.com	We purchased the tv for our bedroom. We purchased it due to the great price and wasn&#39;t so concerned about the picture or sound. It works great for what we use it for. But if I were going to used it in the living room, I would spend a little more and get better sound. The sound is pretty weak. I might go ahead and put 2 external speakers on it anyhow. The picture is better than I expected. Good tv for the price.	5.0	1/7/2015

walmart.com	I ordered this TV for my bedroom. The picture and color is great. I had a little trouble with the sound at first. Make sure you uncheck the surround sound box if you&#39;re not hooking up to a theater system.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/23/2015
walmart.com	We wanted an inexpensive flat-screen for our bedroom that had a sleep timer. This Sceptre 32&#34; fit the bill. It is hooked up to a SD satalite box but still gets a very good picure. Took some phone calls to Sceptre and Direct TV to get it hooked up but works fine now. Of course we have only had it hooked up for 5 days so have no idea how long it will operate but so far very happy.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/23/2015
walmart.com	If you&#39;re expecting to get an incredible TV for dirt cheap, you&#39;re going to be disappointed with this TV. But, if you understand that you get what you pay for, and all you really need is a decent TV for a good price, then you can&#39;t beat this one. The picture is great, and the TV looks very nice, plus plenty of hook-ups in back. Sound quality is lacking and sounds a little like a tin can. Also, the channels are kind of weird when it scans them for you (51-1, 51-2, 54-7, etc.) making it difficult to tell what channel you are on unless you have a cable box or take the time to name the channels in the TV setup which isn&#39;t very difficult. Clicker is a little on the cheap side too, but like I said - you get what you pay for. Great TV for the money!	Clear search field	1/23/2015
walmart.com	A little early to say how good this set is but it is, picture is very nice but not as perfect as some reviews said but definately good, sound is accecptable and clear, i think the only bad thing is how stupid the stand mount is, i bought a wall mount for only 8 bucks here on line and was a breeze to put up but you have to remove a stem on the bottom of the tv and keep for later use if you want it to look nice, overall so far a good buy	Search	1/24/2015
walmart.com	I have bought several Sceptre Televisions in the 32 inch to 42 inch size range. I find them more than acceptable and they seem to be much better in terms of picture quality than other no name brands I have tried like &#34;TCL&#34;. While they are not in the same league as my 60 inch Sharp LED, they do the job in small bedrooms or wherever you would like an extra TV and don&#39;t want to spend a lot of money. I would say Sceptre is on its way to making a name for itself in the TV market in the way Hyundai became an acceptable no joke brand in the car market.	Items in cart	1/28/2015

walmart.com	We ordered this t.v. for our daughter as a Christmas present, we didn&#39;t want to go way over the top due to her age and what it was going to be used for (mostly gaming). The picture is actually better than we hoped for very clear and great quality, and that is it only be used on 480i not the full 720. The sound however is not the greatest, sounds very muffled and mono not stereo. We hooked up speakers to it and now it is just fine.

walmart.com	I have been holding off on writing anything for a couple of weeks to see if any bugs that I had read about might develop. So far, so good. I would say this television is an incredible value. No, not top of the line and anybody that expects that needs to plan on paying at least $300 more. But, for the price, I am not disappointed at all. Positives, very easy set-up, good picture and I haven&#39;t even set up HD yet. Sound is better than what I expected. Anyone complaining about this aspect, no it isn&#39;t a Bose sound system, but once again, it is worth what paid for. Better than expected. Very user friendly as far as settings go. Also, surprised that it has a rotating stand...just an extra plus. Negatives, yes, case is cheaply built. But unless you have a child that attacks everything with something hard, it will hold up just fine. Remote, not the greatest in the world, but use my Comcast remote anyway, so no big deal. As stated, no, the sound is not ideal, but fine for listening at lower levels. Turn it up to much and that is when the inferior sound is noticed. Big deal, hook to surround sound, or as I do, just run through stereo system. At this point in time, I am glad I made this purchase. The Wal-Mart site to store delivery worked well. No problems. Would definitely recommend this to a friend. Will update in the future if something arises.	5.0	7/7/2015

walmart.com	Like many looking at the price tag on this, I was a little skeptical about it. I purchased the 2 year extended warranty, just in case. I don&#39;t know how long it will last. But, straight out of the box, I am quite impressed with this TV. Given the price, you really can&#39;t go wrong. I purchased this TV to go in our master bedroom, so I could mount it on the wall. It is very light. It has a good picture quality. The sound is a little blah, but we don&#39;t need too much out of it for a bedroom. I was told by my satellite installer that these are made by either Hitachi or Sony, but I have not been able to confirm. Overall, I&#39;m very happy with this purchase.	5.0	8/13/2015
walmart.com	I purchased this television as a gift for my boyfriend of 11 years. He&#39;s wanted a flat TV for years and I finally found one in a price range I could manage. I am very satisfied with this television. We don&#39;t have HD available at home, but it is still a very good television. The only improvement I would suggest to the manufacturer is additional input jacks for multiple devises such as a game console and a DVD player without having to switch out the jacks from one to the other.	5.0	8/18/2015
walmart.com	I was a little skeptical, considering I had never heard of the brand name before. But it was such a great deal, I had to go for it. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived.

Overall, I am glad I made the purchase.	5.0	8/19/2015

walmart.com	My 28 inch hi res viewsonic monitor recently died when the power company shot a voltage spike through the 110 line. I wanted something large to replace it and looked at products from many manufacturers. Walmart had the Scepter 32 inch HDTV for 209, plus service plan if wanted. I decided it was so inexpensive I would try it, and if it did not work out, then I would use it as an HDTV. Well - it works great as a monitor. My only complaint, and its not really a complaint, is that I would have liked a higher resolution. There are many HDTV&#39;s out there that have higher res, but they also costs at least 100 dollars more. The Scepter is easily readible, and comes with all sorts of bells and whistles such as built in speakers, and a headphone jack. It also has an input for USB, but I am not using it. It accepts HDTV input and has a VGA jack for input from my computer. It has its own stand, or it can be attached to a wall mount. I use the stand and have no complaints. I am quite sure it will stand up better than a traditional computer monitor, but just be be safe, I bought the 3 years maintenance plan. Total costs for everything, including store pickup, came to less than 275 dollars. My old monitor costs far more than that, so all in all, I think Walmart&#39;s deal is fantastic. I hesitate not a second to recommend this to anyone who is interested. Be aware though that its resolution is limited to 1300x768.	5.0	8/31/2015

walmart.com	I think it is an excellent TV for our room. The only real complaint I have is that the remote control is hard to use. You do have to make sure it is pointed at the blue light or it won&#39;t change the channel and then it may or may not work all the time. (we did put new batteries in it) The sound is OK but could use a little improvement, but it isn&#39;t a deal breaker. Over all a good TV for the price. We bought it site to store and the service was great. Will be making more purchases that way.	5.0	9/21/2015

The sound is good. I was a liitle worried at first about purchasing the TV because of the price, thinking the quality and picture might not be that good because it was so cheap, but now i am very happy.

I bought it when my RCA blew a couple boards. I needed external sound equipment to hear my programming well. I eventually fixed the RCA (which is bigger with great sound) so this one was retired to my bedroom where I rarely watch TV. One advantage to this TV over my old (besides durability) is being an LCD it has 0 interference with my IR technology devices (remote controls and wireless headphones), a problem seen with Plasma TV&#39;s.	5.0	12/7/2011

walmart.com	I read all the reviews, shopped around and did my homework before purchasing this tv. So, when it arrived I knew what to expect. Was worried about the sound based on reviews which for the most part were quite accurate. It did sound a bit tinny and I don&#39;t recommend turning it up too loud as it will vibrate. However my needs do not require that type of sound quality. I did adjust the bass to a much deeper level and so it&#39;s sound is acceptable too us. The picture is very nice and set-up was uncomplicated. It is on every day and we have had it for about 9 months and have not had a problem. I have just ordered another one. My extremely old bedroom tv (the bulky heavy kind we all used to have before these new generation flat televisions) is finally dead. I ordered an Emerson with dvd combo that was on sale at WM. It had good reviews, but boy did I ever learn something. I did not know that some flat tvs could only be watched from directly in front of them. Not 2 feet to one side or the other, or from sitting on the floor. This was not acceptable for me as I often have to lay flat on the floor to do exercise and therapy to relieve back problems - so it is going back, and after again shopping around and doing my homework, found that this Sceptre model that we purchased in January was again going to be the best bet for my money. I am hoping that I can report in another 9 months that the new one I just ordered keeps me as contented as I am so far with this one. I live about 100 miles from the nearest WM store, so I do most of my shopping online for just about everything but groceries, and I always get good service. If I am not happy with a product, WM is very good about accepting a return, which I HAVE had to do a number of times. Not WalMart&#39;s fault - usually just a manufacture problem, or in the case of my recent Emerson tv purchase, the fact that I am not well versed when it comes to the specs of a product. I think the sound is the only drawback with this Septre, but as I understand, that is an inherent trait to almost all flat screen tvs and can be remedied with exterior speakers or a soundbar. Keeping my fingers crossed that the new one is just as good as this one!! I&#39;ll let you know how it turns out.	5.0	12/20/2011

walmart.com	I did a lot of comparison shopping before I bought this TV. I don’t have cable or satellite so I wanted to be sure I could attach my antenna and that it would pick up the over the air signal, which it does(the antenna has HDTV scanning ability, so that might be a factor for you). I didn’t want LED, LCD (to me) has a sharper picture. So far so good, I’m very pleased with this TV.	5.0	12/25/2011

I decided to mount it and it looks even greater up on the wall. Great price and purchase for our bedroom entertainment.

We have a Samsung 1080P TV in our living room with wiFi, etc, so I was worried we would be disappointed with this TV, but for the price it was worth the gamble. If you are looking for a living room TV, definitely get a sound bar or surround sound system. However, for our bedroom it is perfect. Overall we are happy with the TV and the picture but we have only had it a week or so. Set-up was super easy and the TV is super light so I was able to do it all myself without fear of dropping it and ruining it.	5.0	8/26/2012

walmart.com	I am very happy with this tv. It was easy to set. The available ports for older equipment are nice to have. My satellite receiver is an older one that uses the RCA jacks and I was able to use it with this tv without issue. The only negative thing I have to say is that the sound is a little difficult to adjust but, I do not think that it is a problem with the tv. I have the tv in a cabinet with a large hole in the back. The hole was from a previous older tv that was extremely deep. Since the speakers on flat panel tvs tend to be on the sides or back of the unit the sound is not able to bounce off the back of the cabinet like it should. Picture is very good with the satellite signal. The size of the tv is nice. I like the thinner border around the outside edge.	5.0	10/26/2012

walmart.com	I know my review title and rating may seem at odds, but I got this for even less than what is advertised here, so it is a 4 out of 5 for the price I paid. Sadly, this is my main TV and it replaced an Emerson I had for 6 years which just needs capacitors. They are cheap, but of course the service would be as much as this new TV. This TV is so cheaply made compared to the one I had, I was scared it was going to fall over when I set it up. It has a swivel bottom which most people probably like, but I already have a TV swivel. All the connectors are underneath the TV. They couldn&#39;t have put them in the worst place. The only picture choices that will fit on the screen (for TV viewing) are normal and wide. I understand the other choices, for movie watching, but wide is the only setting where you can see people&#39;s heads and their WIDE bodies. The picture is very dark. I&#39;m going to call the company to see how to lighten the picture, even though I think I&#39;ve done all I can. Surprisingly, the sound was not as bad as other reviews. That I can stand. This is a good TV for a kid&#39;s room or basement. I would advise buying the warranty. I&#39;ve been very lucky with my TVs and if this TV lasts 4 years, I will be very surprised, so $24 is not that much to keep it for that long. After being so negative, as I said, for what it cost it is worth it and if it lasts 4 years, it is a deal. But if you are buying this as your only or main TV, I&#39;d look some more.	5.0	11/24/2012
walmart.com	I&#39;ve had this TV in the 40&#34; for over a year and I&#39;ve had no problems with it. I got the 32&#34; for my 97 year old father as a replacement for an old analog TV. He has been complaing about it since I set it up. To be fair he complains about everything I try to do for him. There are two issues with this TV that I&#39;d read about in other reviews before I bought mine. #1: The stand is cheap plastic and wobbly #2: The sound isn&#39;t high quality. I overlook these issues for myself because the price is affordable but this is what my father is complaining about. So I&#39;m buying a wall mount and speaker bars for his TV. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll complain about these too, but I will know I did my best. I think this is pretty decent TV for the price.	5.0	11/27/2012

They mostly watch cartoons and play video games on it, and I love the picture quality, the games (gamecube) almost looks 3D, so Iam very happy with the picture and size of the tv. The only problem I had is when I first plugged it in and programed it I did not like the sound of it, It sounded like a person who has a bad bass system in their car and all you can her is the plastic and metal rattling and after messing around with the bass and tremble controls it sounds much better. I also think if it had more options for plugging in games would be much better, cause they have to disconnect the one system and connect the other one. The boys are happy with their tv and that all that matters. Right?	5.0	3/4/2013

I took it back to my house and took my old TV out. I hooked up the satellite receiver and began flipping through the channels. Now first off, I don&#39;t have HD channels. Without them, the picture is just ok.. Nothing special. The volume had to be turned up really high to even hear it. A few minutes into watching it, the screen FLIPPED OUT. Like the black and white fuzz in 2 stripes going all the way across the screen and making a horrible scratching sound. But only for about 2 seconds. Then it went completely back to normal. If it only did it once and then was fine, I would&#39;ve kept the Tv. However, it would do this every couple of minutes; sometimes every couple of seconds. Extremely annoying. If it wouldn&#39;t do that, it would be a fair little Tv. But I cannot handle the screen tweaking out every other second. I couldn&#39;t find anything on other reviews about this problem so it&#39;s not like I could ask someone else how they fixed it. I returned the TV and got my money back.	5.0	5/1/2013

walmart.com	the sound system needs a 100% improvement, the remote control could use a better design , like the channels # on the bottom, the mute control on the middle, and a few more details that will improve the customer satisfaction with the product	5.0	5/12/2013
walmart.com	Nice looking, good features, good sound.......disappointed in the picture quality. I haven&#39;t tried to change the settings on the color yet, but the factory settings are set that the color of everything is very pale.	5.0	5/17/2013
walmart.com	I ordered and received this tv in good condition and before promised. It was easy to hook up. I was disappointed with the picture quality. Seemed to be grainy and words appeared somewhat blurry. I couldn&#39;t resist ordering at such an awesome price but ended up returning. Bottom line, it was a great deal for a fair to average tv.	5.0	5/23/2013

walmart.com	Although we were very glad to find a 32&#34; HDTV for around $200, the television is already defective. We turned it on this morning and 3/4 of the screen is blacked out. The remaining portions (1/8 on each side) are barely visible. The sound is fine, but the screen is obviously defective. We purchased it online and received it 4/4/2012. On 5/5/2012, it is defective. I am looking forward to seeing how I will be treated: 31 days old, 3 yr extended warranty.	5.0	8/18/2013
walmart.com	This TV is passable - not bad for the price but the sound isn&#39;t great. Worst part is the closed captioning ONLY works with TV or Video input. Not with HDMI or DVR - so no help when sound is less than crisp. Wish I&#39;d known that before I unpacked it and hooked it up. Been too long now ...	5.0	8/26/2013
walmart.com	This is an update to an earlier review. Sceptre did send a postage paid return shipping label. They received the TV 7/12/2012 and had a brand new one back on it&#39;s way 7/13/2012. I received it 7/18/2012. I was without a TV a total of nine days. I like the TV and just hope this one lasts. Both my Toshibas were still working when I replaced them. Had them more than 20 years. Wished I&#39;d kept one as a backup.	5.0	9/2/2013
walmart.com	Speakers are tinny sounding. When I go from tv source to av to play dvd recorder and then try to change source back to tv, I have to manually turn off tv and back on to change source. Is this a problem?	5.0	9/3/2013
walmart.com	I bought this tv and about 6 months later the picture went out (but I still had sound). It had been too long to take it back to walmart so I had to send it to Sceptre to have it repaired. I had to pay the shipping charges to have it sent to them and that was almost $40. I&#39;ve had it back for a few months now and the other night I went to watch a movie on it and it won&#39;t play the movie on my tv...somehow it isn&#39;t picking up the connection from my dvd player. Now for the last few days the closed captioning keeps coming on and I keep having to keep turning it off. Ugh.	Menu	9/3/2013
walmart.com	Good product in general. For some unknown reason however, this TV brand cannot identify some of the local digtital channels that are available in the area. Other than that, the TV is OK if it is not intended to be a product people want to set in the living room of their house.	Toggle Search	9/11/2013

Picture is okay and sound could be better but for the price it is a decent tv. If you don&#39;t watch tv often or aren&#39;t concerned with having top quality then I would recommend the tv. For the everyday gamer or avid tv watcher who wants crisp sound and amazing detail I would look elsewhere.	4.0	10/26/2013
walmart.com	It is difficult for me to rate this product as it was damaged shipping from site to store. The glass on the screen was destroyed. After much haggling and intervention on my part, this was a birthday gift for my daughter who lives 2.5 hours away, the TV was eventually replaced with a different model. So, again, we cannot rate this particular product. It did look awesome on the website and appeared to be the perfect product for my daughter&#39;s rather small apartment, which is why I gave an average rating.	4.0	11/11/2013

walmart.com	We bought this tv because it got decent reviews from others and seemed like a good value. We received this product promptly, set up was a breeze but when we turned the tv on it went to a start up screen and immediately went black. There was nothing my technology savey boyfriend and I could do to remedy the situation. Sceptre&#39;s customer service line has limited hours and when we did call during their business hours we got a voicemail. We also emailed in regards to this problem and got a fairly quick response (within 48 hours). The email said we could either fax them some paper work and whatnot or we could just return the tv to Walmart. We chose the easier of the two options and returned the tv to our local Walmart seamlessly. Because our Walmart does not carry this tv we would have had to order the tv online all over again. We ended up spending $50 more on a Sony and I feel much more confident with that purchase. It&#39;s hard for me to rate the tv as I was never able to actually use it. I didn&#39;t see any other reviews on the Walmart website about others having the same issue as i did so maybe it was just a fluke and we got the dud?	5.0	2/25/2014

walmart.com	After reading the reviews for this TV, decided to purchase for bedroom when price dropped to $209. Love the ship to store option. Brought the TV home, once installed, adjusted picture to the best of its ability by a professional but, not the best picture, even for the price and all the reviews offered. A bit disappointed but still hoping once I get the HD receiver installed, picture quality will improve. Overall, it&#39;s an OK TV for bedroom but, would not recommend for viewing in a family room where quality counts. Only way I would recommend this TV is for gaming or bedroom viewing only but be sure to install the HD receiver for a better quality picture...keeping my fingers crossed it will improve.

It took me about 30 minutes to get the energy star sticker off the front and it&#39;s still not even off all the way. What Walmart is doing is selling floor models from around the country. The remote/manual bag was already open as well. Picture Quality: is terrible compared to other LCDs that i&#39;ve owned. I tried hooking up my laptop to the RGB output and it gave me a headache the quality was so bad. About the only way to get decent quality to this TV is to run 720p+ to it.

Then it took two weeks for them to honor their warranty by having me to mail back my TV without any consideration for your loss of use of their product. Apparently it&#39;ll take 2-3 weeks to fix the TV and they don&#39;t offer a loaner or anything during this time. Definately not what I&#39;m use to with appliance companies.

walmart.com	The transaction with walmart.com was excellent. However, there is a problem with the TV where the remote does not allow turn-off. It performs all other functions well, including turn-on, but when I try to turn it off, it does that for less than a second and then turns back on. I have been emailing with Sceptre back and forth numerous times with very unsatisfactory responses. They sent me a new remote which performed the same. I never did think that the problem was with the remote, but followed their instructions. The end result is that they want the TV back to diagnose it. I had to pay someone to to mount it on the wall and connect it for me. Now they are asking me to dismount it, pack it exactly as they instruct and mail it back to them. I asked if it can be merely exchanged at my local Walmart, from where i picked it up, and they said no. This would cost me additional money to have someone dismount it and then remount a now repaired TV. At that point I will have paid more for the TV than if I had bought it at a retail store, not on sale, and significantly more trouble. I am extremely upset with Scepter&#39;s policy on this and will not purchase another item from them.	4.0	5/30/2014

The technician phoned and said that the set was complicated, but he installed a replacement part and got it to work. However, he said, after working for about an hour the unit again refused to turn on and he could do nothing more.

walmart.com	I bought three of these tvs, one a 46in that sometimes cuts off even though i,ve set the timer to off several times. It still cuts off at different times of the day or night. As for the two 32 in i bought they both died out and wont show a pic at all. i bought the first and had this problem then replaced it with another and it also died a little pass the 3 month period to return to Walmart. Although i think they show very well, I,ve not had the best of luck it seems with any of them, so i would not recommend this product to anyone. I will buy something different, i don,t have time to deal with sending it back and fourth with the company.(MY LOSS) Good luck with this product.	4.0	6/9/2015
walmart.com	Bought 04/13/2012 and lasted till 08/24/2012. Sound OK, but NO picture (blank screen). Since my 90 day &#34;no questions asked&#34; by Wal-Mart period had passed, I could not get a refund or product exchange from Wal-Mart. Believe me, it is no easy thing to return a Sceptre product for repair. No simple phone call to a customer service center. You have to request a RMA (via fax) tough if you do not have access to a fax machine. Then you (the customer) are responsible for the shipping charges to California (I live in N.C.) because they repair at their home base. I have bought my last Sceptre product. I fell for the cheap price, but wish I had bought a more reputable companies product for a little more money. Live and learn.	4.0	6/10/2015
walmart.com	This tv worked great for 3 days. then I started having a problem with turning it on. I would have to unplug the set two or more times in order to turn it on. After a couple of days of turning it on and off, it would not come on at all. I returned it to the nearest Walmart and received a gift card for the amount and used it to purchase my grandchildren&#39;s school supplies. I was not happy at all with this purchase and would not recommend this tv to anyone.	5.0	6/10/2015

walmart.com	I set up this TV and while it worked it did have a nice picture and sound. However, after one week it shut down adn would not turn back on. It was a hassle to reak it down and return it to Walmart. Decided to spend a little more andget a good quality TV.	5.0	9/1/2015
walmart.com	It died after 4 MONTHS! No picture just sound. I loved this TV when I purchased it on July 14, 2012. The picture was great and I could hook the TV up to my computer monitor then drag the tab to the TV to watch. The sound was good too. I made it my main TV over my Samsung purchased last Thanksgiving. Other TV&#39;s with all the features this TV has are much more expensive, but it the long it is probably worth. Sceptre is sending me a box so I can send the tv back for repairs. I guess if the TV last for 2 years it would be worth it, although I would hope it would last longer. So my advice is if you are willing to send it back for repairs and the repairs work...it is probably worth the purchase. Now I have to wait to see how long the repair will take. It has already been a week and my box should be here in two more days. I&#39;ll send it back the next day. I hope it doesn&#39;t take longer than 2 weeks.	5.0	8/30/2015

walmart.com	DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I bought this TV on sale with high hopes and was disappointed. The TV worked fine for a couple of months before it started making a buzzing sound. After 5 months of getting used maybe 2-3 hours a day the TV died. No picture, no sound, nothing. I started doing a little more research and found that I am not the only one to have this problem. It&#39;s too late to return or exchange the product and getting it fixed will cost more than the TV is worth. When I buy my replacement for this one, I will be spending a little more money for quality becaues in the end this &#34;deal&#34; wasn&#39;t worth it.	5.0	9/28/2011

walmart.com	We purchased this TV to replace an unknown name brand unit (Element) that died after a little over 5 years of constant use. After just a couple of weeks this unit started muting &amp; unmuting on it&#39;s own. It was also turning off while we were watching it, and no where near the remote. I believe you get what you pay for in this unit. I suggest spending another $50-$75 and get something that has better sound, better picture, and does not self operate. Walmart was great and took the unit back &amp; gave us full credit from the purchase, including the extended warranty (only because they change their return policy during the holidays). If you buy this unit you are taking a chance. I guess it is possible that we got a lemon out of the bunch, but I would not take the same chance again with my money.	Items in cart	3/7/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this television on the first week in May 2014 and the video Board did not work, hence the picture was not clear at all. I do not know if the TV get damage in shipment as FeDEX was the carrier used by Walmart to ship the item, but I am aware of a story carried by the media that showed FeDex employees throwing items, including electronics, to another employee and the electronic or whatever it is would get damage in most cases. I always purchase all my electronics from Brandsmart and the employees would take the TV out of the box connect it to local cable so you can see that it works before giving it to you and I will continue to purchase my TV&#39;s from Brandsmart and never Walmart.com again unless they can guarantee me that they would check the items themselves at the Site-to- Store before giving it to the person present to collect the item. It is disappointing to receive a piece of electronic, ship it to the Caribbean only to find out it is not working, after you have paid someone to collect the TV, deliver it to the shipping company, pay freight and duties and that is sad. Walmart please get it right and check your products, especially electronic, before you give it to persons who order online and use your site -to store service. I am a very disappointed customer and I will never purchase any electronics from Walmart instore or online unless they institute a similar policy as Brandsmart by checking all electronics before giving them to the customer.	5.0	12/19/2011

Also the volume button would not work on the remote...had to use the cable remote, which the code is 500 from the Sony list if you need it. I took it back today. If you do chance buying this I would highly suggest the extended warranty.	5.0	6/20/2012

walmart.com	I have used their computer monitors and thought they were really good in the past. So I decided to give this TV a try. Horrible is the only word I can use. The sound would shrill and distort if anything action wise (ex. explosions) was being played on the TV. The picture quality was subpar in digital or analog format, maybe I am spoiled by my 1080p set. I returned the set and will spend a little extra on a nicer TV.	5.0	8/31/2012

walmart.com	The saying, &#34;if it looks too good to be true, it probably is&#34; certainly rings true here. I was thrilled to have the 32&#34; set at such a fantastic price - for 15 days - then, no picture. Can&#39;t describe how very, very disappointed I am. 15 days to a non-functioning television is NOT a good deal.	Toggle Search	11/16/2012
walmart.com	I may have liked this tv, if it had actually worked. I unpacked it, put it together, and turned the tv on. Nothing. It turned on, but that was it, just a blank gray screen. Tried in another room, thinking maybe there was a short in the outlet, nope. TV was not functioning. When I returned it to the store, the sales associate said that it was the second tv brought in that week (from a site-to-store order) where the tv was broken. I really hate to be that girl that leaves a negative review, but seriously, I was very upset when my tv didn&#39;t work! Bought another one at another store, worked just fine.	Walmart. Save Money.

When plugged in no picture-just color lines. There was a small tear in the box that lines up with what appears to be an impact on the screen. This was a Walmart.com order, so what do I do?	Walmart.

Then on 12/30/12 (5 days of use) my tv went out. No power at all. Brought it back and spent a little more for a Visio. Then on 1/14/13, my son&#39;s tv went out. Same issue with mine.

walmart.com	I was excited when I received the email that my tv had arrived at Walmart to pick up but had to wait until the next day to pick it up because of all the snow and the fact I have an hour drive from where I live in Amish country and the roads are not a priority for the state to clear. I get it unpacked and assemble the stand, have to have the hubby and son move our old heavy crt tv and it comes on and shows the brand name SCEPTRE and then the screen goes blank, I spent 2 days trying different connection types and had a neighbor, my husband and very electronic savvy son all double check my connections because they were convinced I hooked it up wrong since the brand name showed once powered on they assumed the screen operated plus we had sound. I called the tech support once all avenues were exhausted and when I told him all we&#39;d tried he told me it sounds like the video card is bad and it needs returned. Now it&#39;s all unassembled and packed up but I have to wait for the roads to clear again since it&#39;s snowed a couple more days while figuring this out and I&#39;m not sure if it will be worth my time to exchange and then have to make the trip to pick up another or just find another tv while I&#39;m in town. I was hoping to be able to upgrade to a HDTV and not pay top dollar since we have a limited income as I am disabled following a car accident several yrs ago on my way to work. I would recommend taking the time to open the box at the store even though it&#39;s inconvenient and checking to be sure the menu screen comes up when you press the button on the side then at least you&#39;ll know the screen is working beyond the power up that displays the logo.	5.0	12/8/2012

walmart.com	Regrettably I must give this TV a 1. It actually has nothing to do with the product itself but with the way it was shipped. It arrived at my door two days after ordering. OUTSTANDING speed. However the screen was smashed/cracked. As a result I had to return it to the local store. The reason for the 1 is for the fact that they made no attempt to protect the TV from damage. They simply slapped a shipping label on the product package itself and shipped it with no additional packaging protection. So sad. I&#39;m sure the TV is fine if it doesn&#39;t arrive with a shattered screen. First and last TV ordered online. I&#39;ll just go to the store next time.	5.0	12/28/2012

It was not used on a daily basis and shot in less than 3 months. Purchased the extended warranty through Wal-Mart however it should still be covered under the Manufacture.

I have a 50 inch set, so I put this in my guest room. Now I hang out in the guest room more often than ever before. The picture quality is very good. It&#39;s got some kind of built in feature that helps pull in network TV stations that hooked up to just a $30.00 set of Radio Shack Rabbit ears gets pretty good reception for ME. I don&#39;t watch a lot of TV. I hooked it up to a computer, mounted it on the wall and I&#39;m pretty happy with the whole she-bang. I&#39;m not the easiest guy to please in the world. Not the hardest either, I guess. But to re-phrase what I said, I am EXTREMELY pleased with my purchase. There are 3 HDMI ports and a pretty impressive array of options for audio in and out along with other technology packed in.

walmart.com	I got this cause my daughter moved out and I ended up with a guest bedroom and no TV, didn&#39;t want to spend too much money as I figured it wouldn&#39;t get used much, just wanted it incase. All the other TV&#39;s in the house are Vizio and have always liked the Vizio brand, never had any problems, so I was a little skeptical getting a brand I had never heard of! Boy am I glad I got this! Beautifu sharp picture, so easy to set up. My grandaughter goes in the spare room everytime she comes to visit and watches all her shows in there. I&#39;ve had this about a year now and now problems at all. Highly recommend!	5.0	12/26/2011

walmart.com	I purchased the 32 inch Sceptre HDTV to use as a large screen computer monitor. So far, the color and definition have been really good and I have had no problems with it. I tried the VGA port to see how it looked and it was good then switched to the HDMI port and it&#39;s great. I have not used it as a TV so can&#39;t review that feature. The &#34;brushed metal bezel&#34; described is just black plastic with a kind of mat brushed effect applied. It is still black plastic but is less reflective than the smooth black frame. I read several reviews that the monitor had a short life span. I have only had mine for a couple of weeks and hope it lasts a reasonable time. I upgraded to windows 10 with no video problems.

walmart.com	I read the posted reviews on this TV before purchasing if as a Christmas gift for my daughter in Denver (I am in Maryland). My wife and I were heading out to Denver, so we had it shipped to a friend&#39;s house so I could pick it up and surprise our daughter. I received notification that the TV would arrive earlier than expected. Knowing my friend was away at that time, I contacted FedEx and had it delivered at a nearby FedEx store. All worked out well. The TV was really plug-and-play. Picture is great for the pixelation (680) and I agree with the other reviewers that the sound is weak and tinny, but that&#39;s OK for its expected use. I congratulate WalMart and FedEx for excellent shipping and prices.	Invalid city, state or zip code	11/27/2013

walmart.com	Bought this as a gift for someone and it has all the right features and works fine. Not the best picture out there but certainly acceptable. Sound is not great as mentioned by others, but speakers can be hooked up easily enough. Like the fact it has a tuner, a PC hookup as well as HDMI. My house and the recipient of this gift have the entertainment systems based on computers rather than on other audio/visual components, which to me seems like the way to go.	4.0	12/10/2014

walmart.com	This TV is just what I wanted in my bedroom. I gave 4 stars not 5 due to the sound quality, which is not as clear and deep as my living room Samsung TV. But for an upgrade from tube to flat screen and perfect bedroom size this price was perfect. The TV swivels and comes with its own small screw driver for assembly. And if you’re worried because it’s an unknown brand just buy the $20 Wal-Mart protection plan, gives you 2 more years on top of standard 1 year warranty. Great TV for price!	5.0	1/5/2013
walmart.com	I received the TV earlier than the expected date (that&#39;s a plus right there!) The instructions were excellent. I ordered the non-included VGA cable and the hook-up was seemless. The sound is very low through the TV, but great through my PC that I use as a DVD player. I don&#39;t particularly like the &#34;wide screen&#34; view on channels because people look fat or wide, not proportional. For the price, I think it is a good value. All I need now is a home theatre hookup with speakers and I&#39;ll be a happy camper!	5.0	11/29/2011

There was a lot of pixelization and ghosting which made it very difficult to watch. I ended up returning this and purchasing a Vizio 32&#34; elsewhere. $50 more but well worth it.

The sound was poor and the picture wasn&#39;t very good either. I made several adjustments but didn&#39;t feel the tv was worth the $200 I paid so I returned it.

He is satisfied with the one he has now. I don&#39;t know where the problem lies. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the product itself or it was broken in Walmart.	4.0	11/27/2013

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my bedroom. When it finally arrived, I was horrified at the size of it. It looked way smaller than the size it supposedly is. When I called directv to sync the services, this brand name wasn&#39;t even in the database. The remote control is massive and dated. I didn&#39;t waste one second more trying to deal with that. I immediately packed it up and returned it to Walmart. I spent a few dollars more and bought a better one.	5.0	9/3/2014

walmart.com	Not a great TV but a good spare bedroom purchase. Bought at a great price. Sound is very tinny. Picture is clear but only fair-good quality on vivid display. Sports did not pixelate. Easy to place on stand and hook-up with HDMI cable. It will serve fine for its purpose. If you need a TV for anything more than minimal to moderate use go with a major brand. You will pay more but it will be worth it. I might still buy it again at the price knowing what I know.	5.0	2/16/2015

Something was wrong with the one I got and it had to be returned. This would not be so bad but, I live 20+ miles from Wal-Mart. Instead of waiting for a new one to come in I just bought another tv for an extra $40.00 at the store and it works great.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	7/24/2015
walmart.com	Please!!! If you have read any good reviews disregard, This was the worst shopping experience ever not to mention a huge inconvenience! I bought this tv even after reading the reviews couldn&#39;t beat the price or so i thought..after i got this tv home and moved all my furniture around and got rid of my old tv got it all set up worked for 5 minutes then went fuzzy then went black and would not turn on at all. So i had to return it and spend an extra 200 bucks on a different tv.If you do decide to still buy this tv know that if you buy the warranty and your tv craps out and you take it back you will have to CALL walmart customer service department to get your warranty money back..which i have not done yet. The tv i went with is a 42inch hisense the grand total was $$421.88, so far so good! Hope this review helps.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	7/31/2015

walmart.com	I bought this TV for my husband and me. We were getting a blue-ray player as a part of our Christmas present from our daughter so that when the grandchildren bring their movies, we would now be able to play them. The TV we only had it installed about a month. Went to bed one night and turned off TV and the color was fine when we turned it off. Went to turn it on the next morning and then the color displayed was a very terrible green color that actually hurt my eyes to look at that. The box it came in was still saved so we packed the TV and returned it back to Walmart. Customer Service was very helpful and all of our money was refunded. We then went on a shopping trip to see what we could get that might still be in a price range we can afford and the size we needed.	5.0	5/4/2013

walmart.com	I Bought this television for my son&#39;s room. He is an avid video gamer and the standard definition set was not cutting the mustard, as most games are now designed for HD. It was very easy to connect X-box and other electronic devices. The sound quality isn&#39;t the greatest, but is at least average to others I have heard. Actually the picture quality is better than the high end name brand model I have in my bedroom. If my bedroom HD was to fail...I would have no reservations picking one of these up for myself.	5.0	9/6/2013

walmart.com	For $219 and free shipping, I feel like I stole this TV. I unboxed it, hooked it up, and was watching it in less than fifteen minutes. Very user friendly. The picture quality is EXCELLENT. I put this TV in my bedroom, and watched the football game on it Monday night. The picture quality is easily comparable to the 50 inch brand name TV in my living room. I was a little concerned about some of the complaints regarding the sound quality, but after tweaking the controls a little, it sounds FINE. It also has a built in equalizer (very easy to navigate as well), so if you can&#39;t get this sucker to sound decent enough, then you need to buy a more expensive unit. This TV is not marketed to be the primary unit in an expensive theater system, but for what it is and does, it is simply an outstanding value. It was very easy to program my DirecTv remote; if you have a newer model remote-RC65R-there is a code for Sceptre, and my remote accepted it on the first try...no need to use the Sony code as others have stated. I cannot say enough good things about this TV. It was so easy to set up, program the remote, tweak the audio and picture controls, etc. I fully recommend this TV.	4.0	5/1/2015

The picture is beautiful, very sharp. I have trouble with my eyes, and my old fashioned TV just wasn&#39;t doing it anymore. Now with my new purchase, I no longer have those issues. I can see everything beautifully. The only thing about this TV (and it&#39;s not a deal breaker for me), is that the sound is a little bit &#39;tinny.&#39; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good way to explain it or not. It doesn&#39;t really both me, just wanted to let ya&#39;ll know this. I would definetly recommend this TV to anyone. For the price, it was well worth it!	4.0	3/26/2014

walmart.com	I am so happy with my purchase. This was a gift for my fiance&#39;s 90 year old mother. While she is in very good health, a broken hip injury that she suffered five years ago has limited her mobility, so she watches TV often. I told her sons she deserved a new, larger TV for Christmas. They, of course, agreed. We live on fixed incomes, so had to be frugal with our choice. The 32&#34; Sceptre was one we could afford. I read all the reviews and decided to make the purchase. When it arrived, I set the TV up in my bedroom to ascertain that it was in good condition. I was really impressed. More importantly, she loves the television - says that it was the best Christmas present that she ever received.	Invalid city, state or zip code	12/10/2012

Once I figured it out though it went without a hitch. the picture does not come on immediately (as with the old style TV) but I realize there is a difference in quality, sound, picture and all the necessities from the 1990&#39;s to now. This was a good purchase as far as I am concerned and works well in the space in which it is used. Someday I plan to add the extra speakers...but that will be another project for another day.	4.0	12/29/2012

She called me back and loves this TV, she says it seems huge, and the picture is great and it works overall very well. I did buy the 2 yr extended warranty and called the Walmart Center for it and changed the entire warranty into her name. I have since bought through Walmart online the 42 inch version of this same brand of TV. We were going to spend way more on an LED 46 inch with internet capability but after all the Christmas spending decided that a 42 inch LCD for $359.00 would work out just fine.	4.0	7/19/2013

walmart.com	Very good price and arrived after 4 days. Picture and sound good. One pixel is dead - maybe that&#39;s the reason for the low price.	Menu	12/9/2013
walmart.com	An excellent product that far exceeds the price. And it is true that although it is rated at 720p, the high def channels come in at 1080. The picture is sharp and the colors are vibrant. The sound is good, even when playing music. The only reason I gave it a good regards picture quality is that the non-HD channels are not as sharp. Also although it has all the features I need, I am aware that higher price models come with built in wi-fi and other features not available on this tv. But if you are looking for a good hi def tv at an affordable price, this is the one.	Toggle Search	12/10/2013

walmart.com	I was very impressed with this tv for the price. The picture is very clear and the features are easy to use and understand. The only thing that could be better is the sound. The sound is very clear it&#39;s just not a deep type of sound, but it is a flatscreen so it&#39;s understandable. I&#39;m more impressed with this tv than our 55&#34; RCA and our 27&#34; Sanyo and they both cost alot more money.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	2/27/2014
walmart.com	I was told before I purchased this television that it may now work with my computer since I had an older computer. But I checked before I ordered it and it toke the same type of cord as a regular monitor for a desktop computer. I am hoping to eventually get back with Netflix and be able to watch movies on a 32 inch screen. It is awesome doing my searching on the internet with this size screen. Very satisfied with the product and with the service to receive it.	Clear search field	3/25/2014

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my sons age 5 and 6, and I&#39;m considering getting another one for my bedroom. The Value is excellent which made me a little skeptical about the quality of the TV, but so far no complaints. Both picture and sound are good, It has multiple connections in the back, that allow my kids to have their Xbox 360 and wii plug at the same time which is a plus, no need to plug and unplug every time they want to switch consoles. The base swivels. Overall a great value!	Items in cart	7/10/2014

The picture quality is phenomenal, the sound is excellent, setup was a breeze and we love it. I was hesitant to purchase this tv instead of spending more for a more recognizable name. But as it turns out, Sceptre is made by Sony, which i consider to be a very reputable brand. And this tv way exceeded my expectations!! Love it and would recommend it to anyone.	4.0	1/1/2015

This TV has an awesome picture, easy set up, came with a remote, batteries, cleaning cloth, and a screwdriver for assembling the stand if you need it. This TV is well worth the money.

walmart.com	I bought this TV a couple of weeks ago to replace a dead TV in my exercise room. This Sceptre TV has exceeded my expectations. I read some reviews that did not talk highly of the quality and I was a little worried. I have found the TV to be a quality set with a good set of features. I have found the picture quality to be great. I would consider the construction quality to be closer to a flat screen monitor then a high end TV, but for the price paid, it cant be beat.	4.0	3/8/2015

walmart.com	We have a larger HDTV in the living room but my wife hates football. I purchased this set for our office so I could watch football while she has the living room to herself. I had never heard of the Sceptre brand but, for the price, I decided to give it a try. Boy am I glad I did. I must admit that when I first hooked it up I was not impressed with the standard definition picture. I had an HD-DVR installed a couple of days ago and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. The picture is outstanding, the setup was easy and I could not be happier with what I got for what I paid. This may be the best buy I have ever made on a TV set.	4.0	7/28/2015

walmart.com	I am very satisfied with this hdtv. Paid $209 after xmas and mounted with a 29 dollar mount from amazon. Looks great working very well. Remote codes easily found. Works exactly as advertized. Got via (ship to store) for free shipping. Box looked rough but unit works just fine. This tv is made to work with HDMI and digital cable. For all of you wieners that bought this tv and hooked it up to analog cable, then no wonder the picture look grainy. Getting 3 HDMI ports at this price sold me on this deal. Most only have 2 ports at this size. Don&#39;t hesitate to buy this TV and hook it up to digital cable. I have U-verse and it looks great on the HD channels. Only con I have for this tv is that the speaker is in the rear. The sound bounces off the wall and sounds fine. There are many acoustical settings in the setup that can be changed for better sound. If you don&#39;t take the time to set it up correctly then don&#39;t complain if the audio sounds tinny. Was able to get a 27 dollar warranty though http://www.squaretrade.com for 3 years.

walmart.com	We bought this TV when our old 27 inch, non-flat screen, and very heavy TV quit on us. We shopped around but couldn&#39;t find one in our price range. We wanted a 42&#34; but for the money felt like a 32&#34; would be more in our budget and still fit all of our needs. We then came across Walmart&#39;s &#34;Value of the Day&#34; and oredered it. It came in quicker then we expected, two days less then what it originally told us to expect it. It was easy to set up. We don&#39;t have cable or an antennae so we don&#39;t pick up local channels. We mainly got it to watch movies. And it fits our needs very well. We are happy with it.	Enter city, state or zip code	12/16/2014

It also shipped quickly and was simple to set up...We would highly recommend!	4.0	11/21/2011
walmart.com	This TV is a really good buy. Picture and sound are above average. My only complaint is the remote that comes with the TV is terrible. It is hard to hit the channel you want, and it usually adds numbers to the one you are trying to get to and it takes a bit to long for the remote to go to the right channel. But the TV itself is a great product, so don&#39;t let the fact that is a off brand through you.	4.0	1/26/2012

The price is awesome, and we just wanted a decent sized (not too small, not real big) flat screen HD TV to put in our bedroom, so low cost was important. It fits the bill perfectly. We do have HD cable running to it, and it looks good at the 780hp. We were worried what the difference would be from 1080 but we&#39;re happy with it. Very nice looking tv, great size, great price. Hopefully it lasts us a while.	4.0	2/12/2012

I am debating on purchasing this tv for my daughter as well.	4.0	12/11/2011
walmart.com	We bought these to replace the old picture tube set our son had, and our daughters tiny 19&#34; tv. I found out that the company had been making computer monitors for some time, and they had high ratings so I took a chance. I am simply amazed at this value! The ad and the box all rate these as 720p/1080i tvs, but when we hook the PS3 to the set it picks up the signal in 1080p at 60hz. I was stunned and found this to be consistent. Games and movies that broadcast at 1080p have done so every time. Couple this TV with the extended warranty, and you&#39;ve got a 32&#34; LCD value that can&#39;t be beat! We plan on updating the TV in our bedroom and purchasing an additional 2 more at least to update our basement bar with. We added the iLive sound bar to the sets, and they sound great. The built in speakers are so so, but that is any TV pretty much. The sound bar adds a tremendous increase in sound quality, plus it adds a decent FM tuner, port for your portable MP3 player or iPod type devices, and a good digital clock that&#39;s conventiently located for easy viewing.

walmart.com	I wasn&#39;t sure about buying this T.V. because it was pretty cheap, But it did have a lot of good reviews, also a few bad, of course we all know there has to be some bad in every product that is made, also some people you can never please... That being said, by all means, don&#39;t be afraid to buy this tv, the only way you will be disapointed is if you are one of the unlucky ones and get ahold of one of the bad ones, in that case you have 90 days to take it back to walmart for an exchange. This is the easyest tv&#39;s to hook a computer to and switch back and forth that I have ever had. The sound could be a little better but I also have not tried to set it any other way than when it came out of the box. I could not be more pleased!!!!	4.0	12/28/2011

I had to adjust the brightness level since the presets were all too dark for my taste, but with that locked in it&#39;s great. The sound isn&#39;t exceptional, but that&#39;s to be expected with a flat panel. How big can those speakers be, given the size of the cabinet. All things considered, it&#39;s a great value. Buy one.

walmart.com	I purchased this TV to go into a room that I converted from my son&#39;s bedroom to an exercise room when he moved out. The TV was very easy to set up with our DirecTV and my DVD player. The instructions were easy to follow and set up was done in a matter of minutes. The picture quality is good and the sound is good too. I only use the TV when I&#39;m exercising so I don&#39;t watch it a lot but I&#39;m really impressed with it for what I need it for. We also purchased the 40 inch Sceptre for our lake cottage I feel the same way about that TV as well. For the price, you can&#39;t beat these TV&#39;s. I can&#39;t comment on my long term opinion of the TV&#39;s as we&#39;ve only had them for a few weeks, but I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m as satisfied a year from now as I am today. As a side note I ordered them on the internet &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t find them in the store and did the &#34;ship to store&#34; option and they arrived a couple of days earlier than expected and we received text messages and e-mails advising us they were at the store. I will definitely use Walmart&#39;s website again for any major purchase.	4.0	12/29/2011

walmart.com	Like others, I was skeptical of this tv because I hadn&#39;t heard of Sceptre. Of course, there was a time when Vizio was an untried &#34;I&#39;ve never heard of that brand&#34; brand, too. I actually bought 2 tvs the week I got this: a 40&#34; Toshiba LED/LCD from ABC Warehouse for 429.00 and this one for my bedroom. This tv was EXTREMELY easy to set up (and I&#39;m a technically-challenged person; I have never been able to hook up a VCR). The picture is great. The remote is simple and easy to use. A lot of people complain about the sound, which I don&#39;t get because this tv&#39;s sound is WAY better than the Toshiba downstairs. The Toshiba says &#34;You can change the level all you want. I am outputting sound at the level I want to output. So there&#34;. The sound on the Spectre is pretty darn GOOD! The only complaint I might have is that I do hear a faint buzzing noise (VERY FAINT). I&#39;m not actually sure if this is the dvd player or the tv. It&#39;s almost imperceptible. To sum it, this tv was WELL worth the money. It&#39;s still going good over 2 weeks later. Has a very nice, crisp picture. Menus are easy to navigate. Money well spent. Frankly, I like this tv A LOT more than the 40&#34; Toshiba and do wish I had bought the 40&#34; Sceptre (which was cheaper than the Toshiba) for downstairs. Oh well. Live and learn. Next time, I&#39;m buying another Sceptre.	Items in cart	1/8/2012

Bang for our buck, we couldn&#39;t be happier with this. When we got it delivered, we set it all up &amp; noticed that the picture seemed a little cloudy (using an XBox 360 with an HD cord), but figured out that the game settings were set to accommodate our other TV. The only thing we thought we should mention is that the top seems to be more open (like a vent of some kind perhaps?) than our other flat screen - because of this, we expect to get a little extra dust in there, so we bought some compressed air &amp; plan to pay special attention to it. Nothing we aren&#39;t used to because we used to live in the desert &amp; had to clean all the electronics regularly. Certainly nothing that would make us shy from buying this TV again. Great bargain - thanks Walmart! P.S. FYI - the remote signal is the same for older Sony TVs - found that out the hard way when we had a few frustrating mishaps with volume &amp; power going crazy &#34;on it&#39;s own.&#34;	4.0	1/21/2012
walmart.com	Was skeptical to purchase due to other reviews. Went ahead and bought it because it was the best deal. I was going to use it in my camper. I set it up in the house first. Now I like it so much, I&#39;m keeping it in the house and use an old TV in the camper!	4.0	1/22/2012
walmart.com	I&#39;m not a tech savvy person and buying a tv brand name that I&#39;ve never heard of before was a risk, but the price was the big selling point for me especially a tv this size.

walmart.com	I order my 32 inch Sceptre television about over a week ago and had it ship to the store closest to me. I paid about 240 dollars which includes the 2-year warranty and all the taxes. I went yesterday and picked it up the nice man put the T.V. in the cart and I was on my way. I get home and I open up the box in the box you get the T.V. a controller that comes with 2 AAA batteries, a screwdriver, 5-6 screws, a guide and the warranty. I pick together my T.V. by the way the screwdriver and screws are for the base of the T.V., so anyway after setting up the base I hooked up my Xbox 360 with the HDMI cable and when I set my display options on my Xbox 360 to 720p it looked amazing no ghosting while playing or when watching movies on Netflix. The sound quality of this T.V. is way beyond a 5 and so is the picture quality. This T.v is worth the money go pick it up and enjoy it.	Search	1/28/2012

walmart.com	I was needing a new tv&#39;s for our bedrooms so I decided at 32 in would be big enough but I didn&#39;t know exactly how much they would cost. I reviewed is brand and several other &#34;majors brands&#34; but kept coming back to this SCEPTRE 32. After reading reviews I decided to purchase 2. We got them and we were thrilled. The color was very good, the sound is unbelievable!! I have a Sony 46 Google in my living room and my son&#39;s tv from his room is on 8 can I can hear his just as good. The remote is a nice size, it&#39;s long so you can press the buttons quite easily. The instructions for the tv are presented well. Everything comes in a plactic ziplock type bag for safe keeping and the manual itself is in color from front to back. This might not impress many but how many times have you bought a major label and the manual might be black and white or you have to log on to a website for a manual. haha. These tv&#39;s are worth every penny I spent. If you are wanting any of the smart ty features this isn&#39;t for you but once you get a blu ray connect you can have it. The ports are great. The placement on the side of the tv are good. XBOX looks great on tv. This is a solid product don&#39;t under estimate this brand..Happy viewing	4.0	1/29/2012

walmart.com	I was very skeptical before placing the order. I never heard the brand name and read almost 20% of existing customers reviews. Most of the recommended but still many had complains. Most of the people complained on sound quality. Still I ordered this as I had to buy one TV and it was great deal. But when I plugged in this set with NetGear NeoTV , I just got amazed !!! You can’t expect a better picture quality with this price. And I am fully satisfied with sound quality. I found it very loud and normally I am keeping sound at 10% and never crossed 30% so far. I use this set to watch movies on NetFlix, Databazar mainly.	4.0	1/31/2012

walmart.com	I was really happy with my choice of buying this tv. I had heard of the brand before so I decided to give it a try. The picture is great and it turns on quickly. The sound could be better, when I&#39;m playing a game or watching a movie, loud sounds make a static type noise almost like feedback. I had an extra soundbar so I hooked that up to it and the problem was solved. I am overall extremely pleased with this purchase, and happy I saved a good bit vs a better known name brand.	4.0	2/7/2012
walmart.com	I bought this for my bedroom, which is my primary TV watching location. This was my first flat panel HDTV. I&#39;ve been shopping around for a long time but the prices were still too high. I found this online and bought it immediately. The first thing I noticed was how incredibly light it is. I was able to carry the box one-handed using the built in handle. In comparison, it took 2 of us to move the 27&#34; TV I was replacing. Once I got it home, it only took moments to get it up and working. My only concern is that the stand seems a little flimsy. I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t live in earthquake country. Several other reviews mentioned problems with the sound, and I almost bought a sound bar before the TV was delivered, but I&#39;m really glad I waited. I think the sound is just fine. It blasts me out of the room at 10 (out of 100). I was so happy with it that I bought a second one for my son&#39;s room, and am thinking about getting my daughter one as a graduation present next month. I also recommended this to a friend who was complaining about her husband hogging their 1 TV to watch sports. It was in her price range, so she purchased one, too.	4.0	2/8/2012
walmart.com	The tv has been amazing for what we paid for it. I read all the reviews for it and was a little bit nervous to get and was going to give it a week and return it if it was bad but now I am so happy we have it. The sound on it is really good in my opinion. It is clear and travels well. The picture, I think is really good. It isn&#39;t as great as the top notch tv brands but for what I paid I couldn&#39;t be happier. It has a ton of HDMI ports on it as well, I think three, so that makes it really nice as well.	4.0	2/8/2012
walmart.com	Everyone was shocked at the price and how nice it looks. I think they were kicking themselves for not getting this tv! I like my sound loud and plan on hooking it up to a home theater system. All in all this was a good deal for the price, yes I would recommend it!	4.0	2/8/2012

I would highly recommend this TV as a second set and hope that we still feel this way at the end of the summer usage. We were also very pleased with the prompt delivery of this order.	4.0	2/8/2012

The menu features for adjusting screen viewing size are easy to use too, so when we watch old movies they are not stretched out because we are able to set it to &#34;normal&#34; view instead of &#34;wide&#34; view. So far so good. my only complaint was there is only one hook-up for AV, so I could not hook-up both the Dvd/VCR player and the Wii directly into the TV. I had to route the Wii through the DVD/VCR player which we have connected to the TV. But that even works really well, so it is not really a big deal.	4.0	2/19/2012

walmart.com	I&#39;ve had this for better than a month, and it is far better than I&#39;d even hoped for. It is a real bargain. I liked it so well, I bought a second one, slightly fancier (LCD-LED) for another room.	4.0	3/1/2012

walmart.com	This is a great quality TV at an excellent price. I read several reviews before purchasing this TV, all of which were positive.

walmart.com	This was a mothers day present for my mom. It was shipped to her in Puerto Rico. She is very pleased with it and loves the picture quality. I just loved the fact that Walmart was able to deliver this when they said they would. I was afraid of delays but I was so impress that it got there exactly when they said they it would. Loved t hat I was able to track the package as well. I have never considered purchasing a TV on line but due to me being so far away from mom I didnt have a choice. Glad to see that it arrived safely...and in working order. Thanks Walmart for making my 85 year old mom Mothers Day a special one with her new TV that she didnt expect. Might be getting one for myself now. You cant beat the price...	3.0	3/4/2012

walmart.com	I never heard of this brand Sceptre before but for the price I gave it a try and just love it. The value,quality meets all my expectations.	3.0	3/4/2012
walmart.com	I love the picture, I love the sound, love the fact that it was fairly easy and quick to set up and that I got it within three days of ordering it, and I love, love, love the price. After weeks of looking at TVs in every store possible, we decided to take a chance on this one and figured if it was lacking in comparison to the name brands we would return it and spend the extra money to purchase a name brand. Honestly, I can&#39;t see a difference between this and the name brands we saw in the store. However, before this we had an old school TV in both the living room and bedroom, so this was our first flat screen even (the old ones just wouldn&#39;t quit), and so we were watching previously on something rather primitive - lol. They both died at just about the same time, so we bought the 32 inch to try it, with the idea that we will eventually buy a bigger one for the living room and move this into the bedroom. I will stick with this brand though, from going to the stores and looking at the TVs playing, I just can&#39;t see a difference between this and the higher priced ones, so I don&#39;t see a need to pay more for what I think is essentially the same product. It is only the second day with the new TV, so I have not used any features or anything like that yet.	3.0	3/6/2012
walmart.com	I am sooo happy that I chose this TV!!!! It is awesome, and I didn&#39;t have to wait long to get it;the TV was shipped the next day after I ordered and paid for it, and within 5 days it was at the store ready to be picked up.	3.0	3/7/2012

walmart.com	Since I&#39;ve only had this new 32&#34; Sceptre HDTV a few weeks my remarks will be limited. However having said that I am VERY PLEASED with this product so far! I had a little trouble understanding the Owners Manual but when my Time Warner Cable guy came out to install the HTMI cable, he not only gave me some advice on what the DVR box could do, he also showed me how to use the settitngs on the TV menu. This is my first HD TV and to be quite honest, I really don&#39;t see what the big deal is! As far as I can tell there just isn&#39;t much difference in the picture or the sound when viewing a station in HD or just on the regular channel.	3.0	3/17/2012
walmart.com	We were looking for something that doesn&#39;t take up too much room but looks nice and has current features. We found that is this bargain! The description says 720p but the TV has a 1080 setting! We don&#39;t have it mounted, and I love how the TV swivels on its stand. Makes it easier to be moving wires around. (We aren&#39;t tech savvy, I am sure we probably don&#39;t even need to move wires around) Very happy with the purchase so far. We have had it for around a month and don&#39;t watch tons of TV.	3.0	3/17/2012

walmart.com	Is this the best tv on the market? No. Is it a really good tv for the price? Yes! My beloved old style 20 year old Sony tv got hit by lightning so time to get a new one. Bought one from Best Buy and hated the picture and sound. Returned immediately. Read the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try. I am glad I did! If you think it will be as good as a $1000 tv you are just kidding yourself. That said, the picture is very good. The sound is average for a flat panel tv. It took some trial and error to get it to my liking but once I did, I am extremely pleased. I have already recommended this tv to others and would get another if I needed one.	3.0	3/20/2012

The sound is perfect with the options to use the equalizer or the pre-set options like pop, rock, jazz. I enhanced the actual bass and keep the treble balance, and with the volume on 10 it is absolutely clear. Even when commercials play at different levels on my old box TV...does not happen with the Spectre, just equal sound all the way through. The shipping was incredibly fast, I received it about 3 days after ordering. For my first flatscreen this was the best investment I have ever made.	3.0	3/25/2012

As someone else said, if you&#39;re not expecting the quality of an $800 tv, you should be very pleased with this purchase. IMO, with free shipping, this is the best value for a 32&#34; tv that can be had anywhere. Great as a gift!! I highly recommend!	3.0	3/26/2012

walmart.com	I bought this TV for use in a bedroom. It is everything I would have expected in a value TV. Obviously, the colors and picture aren&#39;t LED quality. But, that shouldn&#39;t be your expectation. The picture is more than adequate for my needs and better than the picture on an older Sony LCD that I have. Sound is adequate, though I typically have the volume turned fairly low. I have only had it for about 2 weeks, so I can&#39;t speak to reliability. One thing I was a little bit worried about with such an &#34;off&#34; brand was the ability to find remote control codes for this TV using my DirecTV remote. It took me 20 minutes or so to figure it out, but one of the generic codes worked and appears to have full functionality. You probably won&#39;t brag to your friends that you have this TV, unless your bragging about the great price you got on a decent LCD.	Search	4/13/2012

I purchased these TV&#39;s online and they came with free shipping. I had them delivered to my job and the delivery driver called me, met me at my car, and helped place them in the back seat. Talk about service, the whole experience from start to finish was awesome. I purchased them on Tuesday and they were delivered on Friday of the same week. Three days is all it took and I am a very satisfied customer. The sound quality is better than excellent as a matter of fact, it was pre-programmed on 23 and when the power was turned on the TV was so loud. We keep the sound down to 16 or 17, but I think it goes as high as 60. This is a great buy. Thanks Walmart.	Enter city, state or zip code	4/14/2012

I was really skeptical with the volume of a $180 TV especially when people complained about TV&#39;s that cost $100 more, but I couldn&#39;t be happier. This TV goes to 100, but I only have to run it somewhere between 20 and 30. I have my Playstation 3 hooked up to it through HDMI and the picture is spectacular. The only complaint is that all of the hookups are rear facing except for the RCA jacks. It would be really hard to hook up more peripherals that require HDMI without having to remove the TV from the mounting bracket. This TV is definitely worth the price!	2.0	4/19/2012

Standard settings are pretty flat, but once you tweak the display settings, the picture can actually be quite nice. Can&#39;t beat the price for a 32 inch TV. Would highly recommend to anyone in search of a 32&#34; on a budget. The sound is as basic as it could be on any flat screen, just connect to a sound system, and your set.	2.0	4/20/2012
walmart.com	I used this tv to replace an old 27&#34; tube type in my bedroom. It is a breeze to set up as the only thing you need to put together is the stand which is configured in such a way that mechanically handicapped people can master this task easily. Then, just plug it in and let it cycle once to detect channels and it is set to go. I spent about 30 minutes opening box to walking out of a completed job. As for the picture and sound? Not theatre quality but plenty good enough and cheap enough for a bedroom late nite show type application. I think one would have to have pretty keen eyesite in order to detect the difference between 720 and 1080 and that is not me.	2.0	4/20/2012
walmart.com	Im not sure what I was expecting when I ordered this tv online but let me just say WOW! I am more than pleased with this purchase. I feel like I got more bang for my buck with this purchase than I have in a very long time. I was so impressed by the way the tv was packaged. Everything was neatly organized for easy installation and even includes a screw driver. As far as picture and sound, the regular cable channels werent as sharp but the HD channels are so crisp. I ONLY HAVE BASIC CABLE BTW so the fact that the tv picked up 165 HD channels tickled me pink!. The sound is pretty good. Its clear and it doesn&#39;t need to be cranked way up to understand whats being said. I am so pleased I may buy another for my sons room. This was a fantastic deal!	2.0	4/21/2012

The base of the tv is a neat feature, since you can swivel the tv to different positions (left to right) without moving the whole tv. The picture and sound are great. Very happy that it has the amount of ports it does. Especially since it has an RCA, to hookup her VCR player. I was very happily surprised given the price of the tv and the bad reviews. The box was pretty banged up when I picked it up site-to-store but the tv was packaged very well. 5 stars since it well deserves it.	2.0	4/21/2012

walmart.com	We probably have like 4 laptops and a desktop computer, don&#39;t have cable, we don&#39;t really watch TV. So we had an old 14in obsolete TV that we kept around, in case we wanted to hear the local channel (idk, news?) in the background. Since like 2010 (?) everything is now digital so we started needing the converter box to connect the antenna for the TV so that we can get the local channels. Our converter box broke, and where we checked, the box was going to cost us at least $50 or more. So it was time for us to finally get a slightly bigger flat screen (to avoid needing the converter box). This one was so cheap I thought (with tax it came up to about $206). Delivered fairly quickly in perfect condition. So far so good, things look clear and nice. Oh by the way, I also learned that this TV (or the newer HDTV for that matter) don&#39;t make the weird high pitch sound (that can be heard when the TV is on, only people under certain age can hear). Explains how outdated my old TV was. Nice product for how much you pay.	2.0	4/22/2012
walmart.com	I paid $189 for the TV. It works fantastic. I bought an HDMI cable the day before my TV was delivered and it looks GREAT connected to my DirecTV box on the HD channels. It looks nice and clear and the colors really stand out. I don&#39;t have it mounted on a wall. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to do that yet! The sound is decent. It doesn&#39;t go very loud.. After around 20 it doesn&#39;t really go louder it just stays the same while the numbers say the volume is increasing. It looks really good on the &#34;Vivid&#34; picture settings but it uses more power. If you watch like sports or racing, this wouldn&#39;t be the TV for you because the picture is kinda laggy. It looks blurry when it&#39;s moving fast. Probably due to only being 60Hz. If you&#39;re just watching sitcoms and reality shows and other types of shows then it&#39;d be perfect. I do recommend an external form of audio like computer speakers or a home audio system.	2.0	4/22/2012

walmart.com	Please note that I have only owned the TV for 2 weeks. The TV was delivered to my door very fast. The remote control was DOA so I called Sceptre and they must be having problems with the remote because they took my address and shipped it out immediately and never asked for a serial or invoice number. I got the remote in 3 days. I own a Sony 55&#34;, a Visio 24&#34; 2 sanyo 22&#34;. On a scale of 1 to 10 the Sceptre picture is a 8.5 and features rank a 9.5. GREAT SURPRISE. The sound was, like most LCD TVs was tinny and without any bass response. I expected that. I had a 2.1 (2 speakers and a subwoffer) on hand so I hooked them up to the headphone out jack and much to my surprise the remote volume control also controlled the headphone volume. This is VERY UNUSUAL so I considered it a BIG BONUS. Next test is to see how long it will last.	Clear search field	5/8/2012

walmart.com	Our TV went out without warning, so I researched the least expensive brands and chose this one from Walmart, knowing that at least at Walmart they had a good return policy if the TV was not a good one. So far, we have been very happy with this Sceptre TV. It is lightweight, looks good, is a perfect size for our room, has a great picture and sound and I never thought I had any use for the swivel feature, but when I am watching by myself, I turn the screen completely in my direction and its like watching at the movie theater. With free shipping, the TV was shipped right to my door in just 3 days which was wonderful. No crowded stores, no loading or unloading, just carry it a few steps and hook up only took a few minutes. We love it so far.	4.0	5/11/2012

This has a great HD picture and want to get a couple more to replace our older tube sets. Best price I had ever seen for a 32&#34;, beat out most of the &#39;black-friday&#39; deals.	4.0	5/11/2012

He enjoys it and I haven&#39;t had any complaints from him. Excellent quality product for a low price.

walmart.com	Let me start by saying I originally ordered a Coby from KMart two days before purchasing this one. I read very bad reviews and immediately grew afraid needless to say I returned it after finding this one online at Walmart for a better price with a warranty, free shipping, and better reviews. With standard shipping it came next day (awesome), very easy stand assembly, included screws, screwdriver, remote, and manual. Picture quality is great for a 720. Sound quality is about accurate for the price, it&#39;s no surround sound; but sounds really good. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.

Com-paired to what we had this is extraordinary. Now its not as good as an RCR or any brands as that but honestly it looks wonderful. Its not very thin its about 2 or 3 inches think but it looks great. The stand some times worries me because my kids will move it but so far it has stood up to the test. A baseball even hit the screen and not one thing was messed up on it. Very great TV and I would buy it again. Thinking about getting another one for the bed room. The sound has to be adjusted but once it is its wonderful and the picture needs an adjustment as well. Other than that its a wonderful TV. Only problem I had was with the remote. Its a bit cheap and stopped working about a couple months after we bought the TV. It only turns the volume up or down. Other than that a very great TV for such a low price.	4.0	6/4/2012

I don&#39;t have cable and so I attached my laptop and surf to the networks online to watch my favorite shows. I have my wii and a blueray player connected, also...full entertainment. Now if I could just figure out how to get my ipod to play through the speakers....If I ever lose the remote, it uses Sony codes for a universal.

walmart.com	My TV is everything I expected, and more. I love the sleek lines. It&#39;s lightweight and was very easy to install. The sound quality needs to be tweaked; but I&#39;m not sure if I can adjust it, or if that&#39;s the way it is. The first time I watched a DVD on it, I panicked because there was no sound. I called technical support, and they were very helpful in guiding me as where to plug in the DVD player. It turned out I had installed it wrong. After that it has worked just fine. I feel it&#39;s a very good product for the money I paid.	Menu	6/24/2012

I have no complaints at all, the tv comes with a swivel stand if you want to set on table, great remote w/batteries, screen mat for wiping it down and an easy to follow idiot proof instructions for hooking up surround sound system or dvd etc; multiple picture and sound aspects.

walmart.com	Just right for the bedroom or den. Nice picture that isn&#39;t distorted on a side glance - it&#39;s picture perfect off to a side as well as straight on. Sound is better than I expected after reading some other review. Light weight and sets up fast. Adjusted tint and hue from as-it-came. For the price it can&#39;t be beat ! A three-year warranty is more than reasonable and I always go this way after having too many other purchases fail a short time after the 1-year warranty expires. As I stated, for the price it was a best buy.	1.0	7/1/2012

walmart.com	You can&#39;t beat this 32&#34; TV for price and quality. Picture is bright and sharp. Several months ago I bought a Sceptre 16&#34; TV for my home desk. The sound needed computer speakers, but for $79 I have no complaints. Now paying $180.00 for the 32&#34;, I couldn&#39;t be more happy. The 32&#34; needed some Eq adjustment with the sound, but I don&#39;t feel I need external speakers like the 16&#34;. I have other TV brands that cost many times more, and I can tell you those other TV don&#39;t justify their higher prices I paid for them. If you are afraid of a lesser known brand of Sceptre, spend another $19 for a 3 year warranty. Walmart shipping on both TVs arrived 2 days earlier than listed on-line. I&#39;m also impressed that both these TVs are so much more energy efficient compared to other TVs I own. The 32&#34; draws only 59w and the 16&#34; draws 13w according to my &#34;Kill-A-Watt&#34; meter. Why spend double or more when these Sceptres do such an excellent job for a basic HDTV.

walmart.com	This TV has a lot of options and whiz bang things I don&#39;t need now but some day I may be able to take advantage of them. The picture is as good as I could ask for. It is a 720 TV so if you have to have the best picture available, you should buy a 1080 but you won&#39;t get it at this price. To tell you the truth, I can&#39;t tell the difference between this TV and my 1080 TV. Maybe if I sat five feet from the TV, I could see a difference. At normal viewing distance, they both look great. This is my sixth flat screen TV. I have one 1080 and now five 720&#39;s. This TV ranks right up near the top of the list. The 1080 wins out but only because it is a 55&#34;. It&#39;s hard for a 32&#34; to compete with a 55&#34; but it is very close. The light sensor that adjusts the picture depending on the amount of room light is a nice feature and you don&#39;t even have to do anything to take advantage of it. There are many input and output options so you can see videos and/or pictures from just about anything that puts them out. I was surprised that there were three HDMI connectors on the back of this TV. At this price I would think you would only get one. For those who want to have a BIG computer screen, this will fill the bill because it also has a computer input on the rear. Another thing that may be useful is the USB connector. With this input you can play music or view your photos/videos from a flash drive. There is nothing that I dislike about this TV. It&#39;s easy to assemble the stand (only 7 screws). That&#39;s it. Just plug it in, connect your video source and put the batteries in the remote. Thanks Sceptre for a great TV and thanks Wal Mart for a great price.	5.0	8/15/2012

It has a great picture, the sound is fine and the features, which I don&#39;t use hardly at all is okay, I guess, but I find no real problems with it at all. It&#39;s price is just right for the size and it&#39;s qualities are right for this tv.	4.0	8/26/2012

walmart.com	This is my first HD TV ever and is working well for me after 7 months of owning it. Picture is crisp and bright. All the input and output jacks make it easy to connect lots of things like DVD, Cable Box, Roku Player, Nintendo Wii and external speakers all at the same time. Great value for the money. Screen is low glare which means I can have my living room table lamps on without seeing their reflections. Sound is only average, even after fiddling with the equalizer. Not bad, just not a lot of richness, and some obvious distortions (like buzzing for some sounds) even at medium volumes. So using a simple red/white RCA cable, I hooked up an old audio amplifier and a pair of bookshelf speakers. Downside is that now there is no remote volume control, but for watching movies and streaming music over Pandora with Roku, the difference in sound quality is night and day. Would recommend a similar old stereo setup, or even a sound bar system if good audio is important to you. Back to the over-all TV experience, remember that this is my main TV and gets lots of use every day. I wanted an inexpensive way to get started in HD television. Many of my local broadcasters, especially sports broadcast in the 720p format - same as this TV. At this size class (32 inches diagonal) there isn&#39;t much difference between that and 1080i, and I am happy with the picture fidelity. Will the X333BV last as long as my old tube TV did? Probably not, but at this price I am pleased with my purchase.	1.0	11/19/2012

walmart.com	I was a little nervous about the sound quality after reading the other reviews. Since the reviews were mixed, I went ahead and gambled that the sound would be fine. I bought this for my daughter&#39;s room. No, it doesn&#39;t have all of the new bells and whistles, but it is a very good TV. We have only had it plugged in for 2 days, so I can&#39;t comment on durability at this time. However, I will definitely update if I have problems. For the price, I would highly recommend the TV.

walmart.com	At 32 inches, it just doesn&#39;t get better than this! We put this in our living room and got it on line for 179.99 just before christmas. It was recently being sold for 197, but still a great deal for this TV. Works Great as long as you have HD. I pay 5 bucks a month for charter HD and it is well worth it. This TV replaced an older 27 inch tube... so for us 32 is plenty big enough and the electric bill won&#39;t be any more than it used to be. This TV will actually use less power... Other than the typical sound issues, this has been great so far. Have had it going for about a week, so I can&#39;t speak to longevity issues, but from the other reviews it seems to be lasting fairly long. But just to make sure, I purchased the 3 year extended warranty for 20 bucks, so that made my total 210.00 I hope this helps.	Toggle Search	11/22/2012

A friend of mine at work said he had bought one (not this brand) and the picture was horrible when watching normal TV so now I was worried even though the main purpose was for gaming. But this TV is awesome!. The picture is crystal clear. I only have an antenna, no cable or anything and when it set up the channels it found 118, everyone of them comes in perfect. With all the inputs and outputs I can do everything I need and more. I got it at a great price. They raised it after I bought it but to me it&#39;s still worth the money.

walmart.com	I took this out of the box, plugged it in, and it auto set to the channels. The channels are different than my old non-flat screen TV, so I have to get used to it. For example the old TV was channels 1-100 (no cable box at this location in the house). This new TV has 1-112, but has A, B, C D after some of the channels. The picture quality is great, the sound is different, almost like I&#39;d like speakers, but totally fine, its just different than the old style TV audio. Some channels dont fill the screen, but that would be the same depending on what I am playing. For $188.00 and no shipping this fully meets expectations and usage requirements.	4.0	11/24/2012

We are using the tabletop stand that comes with it and it does seem a little &#39;loose&#34; on the stand but we think that is because of the little swivel it has.

With it being an off-brand and not a name brand, we werent sure about the quality. But the picture quality was great, and the sound was wonderful!! My parents were very impressed, and couldnt believe the difference in the new TV from their old one. Despite the new one technically being 2&#34; smaller, they dont even notice the difference and enjoy it so much more! I think for the price and the quality of what was gotten, this was a WONDERFUL TV!!!!!!!	1.0	12/3/2012

walmart.com	For a 720p 60Hz HDTV, this TV has an excellent picture. The sound is really good when you adjust the treble, midrange, and bass for your personal needs. Many people forget to do this. The AVL (auto volume level) option allows you to eliminate that annoying volume increase with commercials. There are all the options you need for a TV.

It is also very good in a dual monitor computer configuration for web, artwork, and small details like large spreadsheets. I am also impressed with its range of inputs and outputs.	5.0	12/6/2012

walmart.com	I read the reviews from people who bought the Sceptre 32&#34; Class LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV, X322BV-HD and I was encouraged to buy this product online. We&#39;ve only had this tv for about a week, but I can see it&#39;s a great product for the money....simple as that. I noticed there are some reviewers here giving out a lot of unnecessary technical explanations about this tv that are useless for most people. All I needed to know what that it had a good resolution, good color, good sound....this tv meets all those requirements. We&#39;re not talking about a $2,000.- tv, folks....just $200.- so why all the sophisticated hight tech reviews?? lol, lol, lol. I would definitely recommend this Sceptre model to people who are looking for a good, inexpensive television. Enough said.

In addition, the product includes a number of conveniences that did not come with our Samsung TVs such as a screwdriver to put it together, a cloth to wipe the screen and a swivel built into the base that allows you to easily swivel the screen. Also, the manual was the best manual I have seen of any electronic product that we have purchased recently and certainly much better than the two larger Samsung TVs that we recently purchased. All things considered this is a great product for the price.	5.0	12/10/2012

walmart.com	Bought this TV for the master bedroom. I purchased online and had it shipped directly to my house. TV was easy to set up and very light weight (compared to the 27 inch tube TV it replaced). The remote control was defective out of the box. However, we have another Sceptre TV in one of the other bedrooms and I was able to set it up using that. After that I can use the cable box remote. I contacted Walmart about the remote and they gave me the option of returning the whole package (TV and remote) for exchange or to contact Sceptre via email and deal directly with them. Since Walmart gives you 30 days, I figured I would try dealing with Sceptre and if that didn&#39;t work I could still return. I emailed Sceptre and received a reply indicating that they would mail a new remote to me. 3 days later a new remote arrived in the mail. Great customer service and they have earned a loyal customer.	5.0	12/14/2012

Crystal clear picture, even better than when they were on cable. Easy set up and they can hook up their laptop in a second to stream video, watch a DVD, watch Netflix.	Search	12/20/2012
walmart.com	This tv, is the first tv I have ever bought by myself. I paid the decent price and had some sceptilations (thinking.. that was really cheap.. is it going to be cheap?) but it was not! This tv has a great picture with Charter Communications. Has not let me down and I have had it since the end of Feburary beggining of March or 2013. The only thing I have a proublem with is the sound. The speakers are a little quiet. While I am trying to save the money to buy a speaker bar (will screw into the bottem of the tv.. they are made for this brand and tv.) I have a set of ajustable computer speakers plugged into the headphone jack on the back and have it turned up that way! Wonderful tv.. I would recomend this tv to anyone who wanted a cheap, yet reliable tv!	Items in cart	12/20/2012

walmart.com	My previous TV was quite old and needed a whole mess of wires to watch anything. It ended up being only about $50 to get a new TV than to mess around with the old one, so that&#39;s what I did. The initial set-up was very straight-forward. I love that the TV is able to rotate about 40 degrees to the left and right, so I can still watch shows while I&#39;m cooking in the kitchen. I don&#39;t know a whole lot about the technical aspects of TVs, but the picture quality appears quite sharp, and the sound is top-notch. It looks like it has the ability to go up to about 50 notches in volume, but I&#39;ve never needed it above 10. For a 32&#34; TV, this one&#39;s a good value, thus far, for the cost.	4.0	12/21/2012

walmart.com	The TV frame and integral mount are quality and the rigidity of the stand was superior to other brands I have seen. This TV is capable of cable or over the air digital TV. I recently purchased a rotating antenna which gave me 10 additional viewable channels for a total of 14 out of 19 channels. This TV has an integrated digital receiver so my intention was to throw away the additional digital box and clean up the the TV&#39;s appearance in the room, and finally appear somewhat contemporary. This digital receiver picked up less channels than my old TV with the digital box but the picture was incredibly clear; the sound was super. However, this TV does not have a digital signal strength meter to allow me to rotate my antenna to pick up the additional channels- I would have to keep the digital box that I already have. The manual says the set requires ??% signal strength for over the air digital TV or the picture or sound may not operate and one needs to contact the cable or satellite company to adjust the strength. The bottom line is this set is perfectly priced and it will astonish those of you with old-world technology on cable or satellite systems, it will even perform well on digital air TV if somehow you can point the antenna without a signal strength meter.	1.0	1/17/2013

walmart.com	While I bought this tv as a gift, I picked it up, (Wal-Mart site to store is PHENOMINAL!!!) My brother installed it, and it was incredibly easy to hook everything up. When we had questions of how to proceed, the owners manual was concise and precise. The TV was hooked up to cable, and the picture is a very high quality, sharp images. What I especially liked was the USB port hook up, to me that will be all the difference in viewing pictures and other type media. WalMart, thank you. Sceptre, thank you. I definitely and highly recommend this TV, and would purchase another one in a heart beat. The question now is, how long will it last.	Invalid city, state or zip code	1/26/2013

This model at 720p enabled a much lower price for the 32 inch tv. Hookup was easy and had not only HDMI but a full range of other plug-ins for older equipement such as the digital tv box. Bought a new dvd player with hdmi cables and it works just fine on the Sceptre.

walmart.com	I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting anything really good out of this TV so I was pleasantly surprised. I only watch a couple of things a week (no sports or super fast action) so I can&#39;t comment on how well it works for all types of programming, but it does just fine for regular shows. I have it set up about 8 feet from where I sit and the resolution and clarity is excellent. To me the sound isn&#39;t bad at all but I can see where someone who watches movies would want better and would probably own a surround sound set up anyway. I&#39;ve only had it a month so I can&#39;t comment on longevity but so far so good.	2.0	3/25/2013
walmart.com	We bought this for our 2nd home and didn&#39;t expect a lot for the price. It was surprisingly good in the picture quality area, sound is poor to OK. I have the sound coming through an external sound set-up so it sounds great this way (same as what we do for our LG 55&#34; TV). Picture is bright enough, very good color, no Internet or other features like this. No problem if you have an Apple TV, Roku, etc. Would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 2nd, or bedroom / den, rev-room / garage TV.	1.0	3/25/2013

My son went from averageing a score of 11-15 kills to a high of 38 kills! Great for COD MW3 as well! The XBOX 360 avatar menu actualy shows 4-1/2 users at a time instead of just 3 to select from.

Therefore I had to order another one for the den. I love the sumple to understand remote control. Setup was a breezy. I only have to have the volume on 1. The 19&#34; (other brand) originally had by my bed had to have it&#39;s volume up all the way for me to hear it. I set everything internally on the volume and I still had a hard time hearing it.

walmart.com	I got this TV on Black Friday for $170. For a 32&#39;&#39; TV its price is very worthy. The image quality looks good to me (although I don&#39;t have high requirement for that). I connected it to my wii u, and everything works fine up to now.	5.0	8/28/2013

walmart.com	With some &#34;fine tuning&#34; for personal preference it has a great picture. I found the &#34;Dynamic&#34; as well as the &#34;Vivid&#34; settings to be personally most pleasing. The orange &#34;sound&#34; button and the &#34;picture&#34; button on the remote really made a difference. I did find the sound to be a little &#34;tinny&#34; as some of the other reviewers commented on. I turned the bass up to the maximum and then it was fine. Sceptre is made by Hitachi and so far I am very pleased with the product. It is used daily for TV watching in the bedroom. You can&#39;t beat the price.	5.0	8/28/2013

walmart.com	An unfamiliar brand, but an unbeatable price. It is very slim and has decent picture quality. Sound is a little small, have to turn it up to mid forties in volume to really hear it. However, that is the way most these flat screens are designed, with the picture in mind and very little effort given to sound. Would recommend getting a sound bar or some type of extra speakers with this TV.	5.0	9/12/2013
walmart.com	It&#39;s not 1080p, but you don&#39;t really need that for most things. The picture is a bit crisper than my old HDTV and the sound is better. It also has quite a few ways to change up the sound that I enjoy. It&#39;s good for its price definitely.	Menu	9/12/2013

Wow, what a difference. This Sceptre has a better picture, more features, more controls and adjustments possible (picture, etc)..AND it can play MP3s from a USB drive plugged into it...AND it can play those MP3s at the same time it plays a slideshow of your pictures on that same USB drive. The Insigina cannot do this. Hopefully this Sceptre will hold up for the long run.	Menu	9/29/2013

walmart.com	Love it! Got it at an excellent price! Like the fact that the TV will swivel on it&#39;s base so that others that are not directly in front of the TV can also get a good view. Just wish the sound menu would come with a game option. Certain games have specific sounds either raised or lowered and if they are raised, they blare through the TV, leaving the lowered sounds sounding muffled. To do away with this problem, I turn on my surround speakers and continue playing. Overall a great buy!	4.0	10/12/2013

The set has 3 HDMI ports and this too, was also an important feature that made me decide on getting this HDTV.

walmart.com	The TV tuner didn&#39;t really work for me (at least in my bedroom in NYC) but I was able to connect my Leaf Plus and was able to get all the basic channels without issues. 3 HDMI&#39;s is great as most TV&#39;s in this price range only have 2 inputs. It works well with my Google Chromecast and Apple TV. Although it&#39;s 720p - you can&#39;t really tell the difference since the TV is small. Overall, great product for less than 200USD. I&#39;ve read some reviews that this unit wouldn&#39;t last more than 10-12 months. I&#39;ve only had it for 1.5 months so it&#39;s hard to gauge. With this price - it makes sense to replace it every other year.	4.0	12/3/2013

The sound is a little off, but it&#39;s all good after you tweak the equalizer a little. My only complaint is the remote it came with; I don&#39;t know how to program it and the instruction manual isn&#39;t very helpful. All it says is that it &#34;follows Sony&#39;s programing code&#34; and that I would have to &#34;refer to my universal or cable/satellite remote manual&#34;. Still, I love this TV.

walmart.com	I just bought my 2nd Sceptre 32&#34; 720p since it was on clearance and I was thinking of getting a tv for the guest bedroom. I have had my 1st one for about 1 1/2 years now and the picture and sound is still great. My husband likes to have the tv on all night long and since he is retired, he takes his little senior naps with it on so it is virtually on more than its off. I have a 50&#34; Panasonic in the living room and this one can run with the big boys. For the reasonable price it sells for I may just get a 3rd one for a back up.	5.0	2/19/2014

walmart.com	I purchased this 32&#34; Sceptre for my bedroom after reading many positive reviews. With a cost of nearly $100 less than anything in its class, I decided it was worth the gamble. Shipping was free, and arrived in 4 days. Setup was easy, and was able to use my existing wall mount (400mm x 200mm) from my old 26&#34; tv. Sound quality leaves a bit to be desired, but picture is absolutely beautiful! I added a $25 2.1 computer sound system with sub-woofer, plugged it into the headphone jack, and now have quality sound.

walmart.com	We&#39;ve had a 32&#34; LED HDTV Sceptre (1080P-60Hz) in our bedroom for almost 3 years that we love and haven&#39;t had a single problem with it (also purchased through WalMart.com). Felt comfortable enough to recommend as a combined family birthday present. Picked this one because birthday girl has cable that only supports 720P (1080P would have been a waste). Great picture, sound is fine for us normal people, great price, free super fast delivery right to our front door -- what&#39;s not to love? Also purchased the $24.00 4-year warranty. Hope we never need it but just in case we decided &#34;can we really not afford to insure this for only $6.00 per year?&#34;	5.0	2/27/2014

Set up was VERY easy, and this TV comes with it&#39;s own stand. They even include a screwdriver to install the 8 screws into the base!

walmart.com	This was the tv we got for Black Friday&#39;s $99 32 inch tv sale. We bought it for our 8 year old daughter for Christmas. My husband hung it on the wall, hooked up the dvd player, had Dish come out to install a box for her and now she is in her own dream world! This tv is great! I have sat in her room watching it with her and I have to say it is pretty great. The picture is as good, if not better, than the more expensive ones we have in the rest of our house. The sound is great too, of course she doesn&#39;t have to turn it up too loud since it is just her and she usually has no other noise to compete with. I know I got a great deal on this and hope they offer them again because I will buy a few more for presents!	5.0	3/25/2014

walmart.com	Bright, sharp picture. Lots of ports to plug it in. Was ready to use out of the box in 15 minutes. The only downside is that its mounting holes were neither VESA 75 or 100 standard separation. I had planned on using a mount that previously held a 24&#34; computer monitor and the mounts won&#39;t fit, even though the mount will hold both the size and weight of the TV. It is very difficult to find a desk mount for anything other than 75 or 100 and I did not want to put holes in the wall.	5.0	4/7/2014

I was very pleased with how easy it was to setup the TV which was just place it on its stand plug it in and it was ready. The picture is phenomenal. This is my first HD TV so I was surprised out how clear and detailed everything looks. I&#39;m currently using my TV as a computer monitor and it really is enhanced my gaming experience. I play a lot of online games and the graphics are great. Left4Dead 2 looks so good on this TV. When my daughter saw my TV and how great it is for gaming I had to purchase her one too for her PS3, which by the way the 3 HMDI ports are a blessing because switching between computer/console is a breeze with a press of the button. However I would suggest investing in a great pair of speakers because the sound is rather low but then again it could just be because I have it connected to my computer via a mini jack audio plug. If you are looking for a new computer monitor or just a great TV look no further.	5.0	6/2/2014

Ty the way, the reviews were excellent by the way of being informative and helpful. This TV has 3 HDMI inputs which is more than my more expensive TV in the living room! Although it took me more than 5 minutes to connect, (about 15), the picture is vibrant and clear using the HDMI cable, not so great using the regular cable. It is the perfect size for my bedroom which is why I bought it. I have had no trouble since I powered own and am thoroughly enjoying it! Thank you Walmart.

Made by Sony, it is a great picture. I don&#39;t use the regular speakers, and I&#39;m pretty sure that if I had to, they would be fine for this not too small, not too large tv. So good, in fact, I&#39;m now taking a serious plunge on a sceptre 49 in 4k tv that I got the best black fFriday/cyber Monday deal on! I&#39;ll keep you posted....	5.0	6/13/2014

walmart.com	I can&#39;t say one bad thing about this TV. A few features even surprised me, because I&#39;ve not seen them my other TVs before. First, it has a swivel base and can rotate easily left and right. Second, they included a cleaning cloth! Finally, it can set its time and date automatically. Sceptre is going to give the other brands a real run for their money! They also have a great web site, too.	5.0	6/15/2014

walmart.com	For the first time EVER (at age 66) I have a TV in my room. It is perfect size &amp; quality. One thing I should point out to you. I ordered late Tuesday online. Received an e-mail on Thursday 12-04-14 it had been shipped (very quick service). The e-mail said I would receive by Dec. 20th. Therefore, I was quite surprised when I received a phone call before 6 PM Thursday stating my TV was left in their driveway/sidewalk area. It clearly showed it was the picture &amp; description. She took pocession to protect it, called me that night &amp; delivered it to my door. I gave her a gift (a teddy bear I had purchased as a Christmas present for someone else) I so appreciated her honesty. FedEx was the shipping company. Thank you! Kathie	5.0	6/30/2014

walmart.com	I ordered this tv on Cyber Monday and it came a week before the scheduled delivery time. Now that might be bad if I was going to be out of town, but since I was home it was ok. You have to put a few (6-8?) screws in the stand to set it up but the screwdriver that comes with it is inadequate so just use your own. It only takes a few minutes. The tv isn&#39;t very loud, so you might want to connect it to a speaker system. Overall I&#39;d recommend it as a cheap guest/not main TV.	Toggle Search	7/4/2014

walmart.com	Bought this TV after my son and his friend broke the screen on my 2nd Plasma with a Wii remote. While it&#39;s only used for gaming, it has a surprisingly great picture for a low end TV. The sound is lacking as expected from a flat screen which is why I didn&#39;t reduce the rating. A quick search on the internet for calibration settings and the picture is near perfect and out performs my older but higher end 32&#34; LCD Samsung. If you&#39;re looking for a low budget TV with high quality picture then look no further.	5.0	7/31/2014

With all its features and multi HDMI jacks, USB jack ,Audio out jack and the others as well it takes care of ALL the components I have and gives me the ability to use my stereo system for added listening enjoyment. I find the matte screen to be excellent for fighting glare and the ability to swivel the screen adds for perfect viewing from multiple angles. The hookup instructions were easy to follow and the added screwdriver made assembly quick;the screen cleaning cloth was also very useful. In addition to these values I found the customer service people knowledgeable and friendly. I would recommend this television to anyone who is looking for a great product at an unbelievable price decide for yourself as I did.

walmart.com	We bought this TV for our master bedroom to replace our tiny 19&#34; and I&#39;ve got to tell you it is great. I research EVERYTHING before I buy something and read a whole bunch of reviews here regarding this TV. The first thing that you have to realize when reading reviews is to review the product - not Walmart or the dockworker, shipping company or how the weather is. The bottom line is this TV has a great picture and the sound is perfect. The sound was my big shopping/selection issue because we run a ceiling fan and an oscillating fan every night and we needed enough volume so it wouldn&#39;t be drowned out by the fans. This TV has it. Can&#39;t beat the price and has all of the input/output plugs that you will require. I run it using OTA antenna and get as good of picture as the very expensive Samsung in our family room.	5.0	11/17/2014

walmart.com	I was initially told by walmart people that this brand was the bottom of the major brands - but that it was still a good tv.

Well my daughter talked me into getting this TV, they didn&#39;t have this particular one at my local store but I was able to get an idea of the size and weight and went home and ordered it online. Shipping to my home was supposed to take one week, however it arrived in two days. Lucky for me my daughter was still visiting and she set it all up which took her about five minutes. I love it, I love the picture, the sound, the remote, everything about this TV plus the fact that it swivels to boot. Great TV for the bedroom, at a wonderful price.	5.0	12/18/2014
walmart.com	I ordered this unit online on a Tuesday requesting the standard free shipping. My new Sceptre was delivered to my front door on Thursday the same week. It was well packaged and easy to set up. It does come with a small screwdriver for attaching the base, but a regular size Phillips was much easier to use. Set up was simple and the picture is crisp and clear with awesome color.	5.0	12/18/2014

walmart.com	Like most of the reviews, I can only say these are better than great buys for your money. I originally bought a 50&#34; for my home which was great right out of the box and has been since I got it 8 mos. ago. I then purchased another 50&#34; for my business along with two 32&#34; TV&#39;s as well. If you looking for a great buy, this is it! The parts are from Sony but without the name and frills. I have less than $1,100.00 in all 4 TV&#39;s even with the warranty plans!	Menu	12/19/2014
walmart.com	This is the second 32&#34; Sceptre TV I have purchased. One for myself and another for my Son. It is a great LED TV for the money. The picture is great, the remote control is very easy to use &amp; all the plug ins are easy to reach &amp; easily identifiable. The TV itself looks great and very modern with swivel base. I would definitely recommend this TV, especially if money is tight.	Toggle Search	12/19/2014

walmart.com	This is the second TV that I have purchased by this manufacturer. The first was a 50&#34; for my Dad for Christmas and this one for my self to replace a 19&#34; flat screen that I had. The reviews are worth reading, most of the things written (at least on the positive side) are true. The picture is bright and clear, you have several screen options (Wide, Normal, Cinema, Zoom, etc), you have a few audio options, the menu system is easy to navigate and understand. This is well worth the price.	Clear search field	12/19/2014

I received the box rather quickly and what my husband was even more impressed with was the fact the box came with a screwdriver to put it together and a cleaning cloth for the TV along with everything else that was included in the package. Pretty simple for him to put together in less then 20 minutes and it&#39;s a decent size upgrade for us. We are slowly still replacing old TVs with newer flatscreen&#39;s so the sale was really a steal for us. We love sales but it also has to be a good product and this really is.

The base has a nice turn feature which is great considering the way the TV is set up its easy to see if you&#39;re in bed or if you&#39;re on the love seat. Just turn the tv a little and viola. My only real &#34;complaint&#34; is the remote with a thousand buttons. It&#39;s pretty much a universal style remote, so if you are getting his for a non tech savvy person the remote will be a bit confusing.

walmart.com	I bought this 32&#34; Sceptre after seeing the 24&#34; my son bought. Let me say first that I am not a fan of flat screen TVs. I much prefer the old CRTs. One main reason is the sound quality. Even the most expensive flat screen has little speakers that give you a tinny, offensive sound quality. I was able to adjust the picture, brightness, color, etc on this TV to create the experience perfect for me, but I couldn&#39;t get used to the sound. However, a set of speakers for $20 solved that problem for me. I am very happy with the size of the screen, the picture quality and the features of this television. It has 3 HDMI ports, USB port, composite, VGA and coax as well. Whatever your set up for cable or broadcast or streaming entertainment, you will be able to hook up all the devices you could possibly want. So far, I am very happy with the purchase, the TV is a great value at Walmart&#39;s low price - it&#39;s $10 less now than when I bought it!	5.0	2/5/2015

walmart.com	I purchased this on line and had it delivered to my home address for FREE and you can&#39;t beat that price. When I went to open the box, wasn&#39;t expecting a TV in it due to the weight. I was shocked to see how easy it was to put the base together, they even give a free screw driver for the base mounting. The only problem with I had found is that the speakers are in the rear and when you have it in a entertainment center. I have to purchase a sound bar to get good sound. The picture is really great, the only problem I had as setup was the remote control. I have Dish TV and they have their own remote and it won&#39;t work as a single remote. I have to use 2 remotes, 1 to adjust the sound and turn on &amp; off, and the other for channels and grid and recordings. Other then that I really like this TV and would buy another one but larger one for my bedroom!	5.0	2/27/2015

walmart.com	I have been living with 3 tvs in my house that were 15 to 25 years old. The price of newer tvs have always been too expensive for me to upgrade. After my 32&#34; older tv died I had to finally look for a tv I could afford. Not only did I need an affordable tv, I also needed a tv that had a quam tuner in it because I only have one cable box in my house. I came across the Sceptre at Walmart.com. Not only was it on sale but it also had a quam tuner. It was so easy to hook up and once I turned it on, I felt like I was at a movie theatre. Beautiful vivid color. So easy to make any adjustments with the remote. Why anyone would pay hundreds of dollars for a tv when the Sceptre is all you need.	5.0	5/28/2015

walmart.com	this TV was actually purchased for me by some people who wanted to make sure that I have entertainment for my new place! The TV turned out to be such an unexpected surprise, that when it was time for me to buy a bigger TV, I chose Sceptre, this time there are 49 in ultra HD! I&#39;ve got it almost a year now, I haven&#39;t had one problem with it either.	5.0	6/24/2015

walmart.com	I like this tv for mostly all of it&#39;s features and functions. The only thing i&#39;m not completely happy with is the sound. The tv can be difficult to hear effectively with any other outside noise, such as a fan. The speakers must not be a high enough grade to have more amplification behind them. I usually have to turn on the surround sound receiver to hear it effectively. One other small thing. The swivel set up that mounts the tv to it&#39;s stand is a little too wobbly. This tv has an excellent picture. I sit only 4 feet away and it is sharp, crisp and has very good contrast and brilliant color. The details you see with 720p is very surprising. Sometimes there is more detail on facial closeups than i want to see. With the addition of my bluray player with wifi and Chromecast it has become a smart tv, when needed. I give it 5 stars because the faults are very small, and most flat screen tv&#39;s suffer from insufficient sound. This is something that all tv makers need to work on.	5.0	6/28/2015

(kinda hard to explain) even with mutiple attempts to adjust it. its a little off still ,but not a deal breaker. good value at 229.00 dollars.	4.0	8/5/2015

We decided to go cheap and this looked like the best value for our tight budget. We were extra suprised to receive the tv the next day although we did not opt for next day shippment. We unpacked and plugged in (we do not have any piped in t.v.) to DVD and VCR and our four little boys immediately were able to watch (modern television). The sound was terrible so we added some old P.C. speakers (Harman Kardon) and they worked excellent. We do have a lot of other tech items such as android phone, digital camera and p.c. so we can utilize the t.v. for other things instead of cable or air. All in all we love our t.v. Thanks.	5.0	8/6/2015
walmart.com	Needed a new TV, and this one was a good size and a decent value. The 3 HDMI ports were also a big factor. They allow you to have a computer, gaming system, and cable all hooked up at the same time. It also comes with an adjustable base/mount that makes positionion/changing screen direction simple. And it is pretty light weight. Really good picture quality, sound is somewhat lacking but not a real problem. Overall I&#39;d say it was a good purchase. Only had the tv a few weeks, and had not previously owned/even heard of the Sceptre brand. All in all I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product for such a low price/unknown brand.	5.0	8/6/2015

It was a bit fuzzy. We played with it and it is better now. we will have to buy another DVR to use the HDMI hook up. Just little things dealing with hook ups i was going to take it back, but my husband talked me out of it. We will just update our electronics.

I noticed when I have the volume turned up past a certain point, the sound gets so &#34;tinny&#34; sounding it actually hurts my ears. Maybe someday I&#39;ll buy a sound system to overcome that issue; for now, I just keep volume slightly lower than I&#39;m used to.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	8/22/2015

walmart.com	Reviewing this from a gaming point of view: Bought this primarily for PS3 via HDMI. Needs good amount of adjusting the picture settings (especially the sharpness settings which can greatly effect the quality of the picture, I recommend setting it on the lower end). But after that the picture quality is very good. Ghosting is not a big issue while playing (got it shipped and because of that it was out in the cold, picture was ghosting a lot but only because the lcd was cold after it warmed up ghosting not a big issue). Sound is average. TV has extra capabilities like playing music, photos, etc off a USB drive. Bought it on sale for $209. Great tv for the price. Blu-rays movies also look good on this tv.	5.0	8/4/2015

walmart.com	We just got this t.v. a couple weeks ago and have been really happy with our purchase. It has a good picture, good sound and a great price. Our only dislike is we cannot play videos from our flash drive via the usb but can only play music or view pictures.	5.0	9/8/2015
walmart.com	It is a good TV for the price, but I guess I expected a little more. I&#39;m not very techy, and it took me a while to get the picture the way I wanted it- the color, and sharpness.	5.0	9/8/2015
walmart.com	Well, my summary says it all. We bought this as a step up from the TV we had in our living room. Since we hope to eventually get a huge 3D TV and make this our bedroom TV, we weren&#39;t concerned with having all the bells and whistles. Overall, it was a pleasant surprise. The picture is great and we&#39;ve used it non-stop since it arrived 3 weeks ago with no problems. Our only complaint is that the sound quality on it is horrid...even after adjusting the sound settings. I think with a home surround sound hooked up to it or something it would be fine. There is an option in the menu for turning off the internal speakers and using auxiliary ones, so this shouldn&#39;t be too much of an issue. There is even a headphone jack, so you could probably hook it up to mp3 speakers in a pinch. We just haven&#39;t gotten around to that yet since Dora the Explorer doesn&#39;t really require great sound quality. :-P	5.0	9/10/2015

walmart.com	Not even close to the higher end TVs out there, but we were looking for a cheap TV for my son&#39;s room for XBox and DVDs, and this fit the bill. For the PRICE (we paid under $200), this seems to be a great value. There is a small, faint gray dot in the center of the screen, but it is only noticeable when the screen is fully black. I wouldn&#39;t get this for a main living room TV or if you are a real video fanatic, but for a cheap secondary unit, it works well. Easy to set up.	Menu	9/11/2015

walmart.com	I purchased an off brand tv at another retailer and within a few days the screen went green. this happened twice so i took it back and purchased this TV mostly b/c of pricing. I did not want to spend too much $$ and the reviews for the most part seemed very good. I put a DVD in the first day i set it up and my friend and i where amazed at the picture quality. I have not been home much lately to give a full review on all the features but the screen has turned green on me a few times so i looked it up online and think it has something to do with the manufacturing setting so when it happens i go into settings and reset it and the picture comes back. So far pleased with my purchase	Clear search field	9/13/2015
walmart.com	The TV information packet mentions it doesn&#39;t have a battery and this may impact your setup because it did mine. I almost returned this TV due to thinking it was defective due to the non-responsive state of both the remote and the buttons on the TV while it&#39;s capacitors were charging. The TV will keep shutting itself off (energy star compliance) claiming no input sources and the remote will seem to be non-functional until then. In my case it was also complicated due to the fact the onscreen menu was in French. After the TV &#34;charged&#34; up it then became responsive with an excellent picture and decent speakers. I haven&#39;t tried the USB port on it yet so I don&#39;t know how it would respond as a picture frame nor mp3 player. It has the three hdmi inputs in the back and the other inputs on the side but back of the tv since it&#39;s a tiered depth device. It has a headphone jack back there but no analog rca variable volume output to connect to a stereo unit to use the TV&#39;s remote to control the volume (wanted to connect a subwoofer to it and couldn&#39;t, this may impact your choice of soundbars to connect to it) though it does have a digital audio output. It can also take a 1080p input at 60hz and playback well since we were using a Sony PS3 to play media to it. It&#39;s a good TV at a great price.	Search	9/14/2015

walmart.com	I bought this TV to play my Xbox 360 on, and I absolutely love it, especially for the price. I did not want to spend too much money while not giving up too much quality. I decided to buy another one for my girlfriend for her birthday and she enjoys it as well. That being said, it is only good for the context wpin which we use them. We have small bedrooms, so the sound is great for us in a smaller bedroom. However, in a larger room, as most other reviewers have pointed out, the sound is really not that great. It sounds like it comes from a single speaker in the back of the tv so that even when the sound was turned up all the way, and surround turned on, it didn&#39;t make that much of a difference. Now my biggest problem with this tv, which really irks me: from both TVs I have bought, they both came with a very annoying dead green pixel somewhere on the screen. For mine it is right dead middle of the screen and is very distracting. This has happened to both TVs now and is my biggest problem with this tv.	Items in cart	1/2/2015

I really have no complaints if you are looking for a basic tv with good picture quality and don&#39;t have a clue about refresh rate etc. However, if you plan on using it for over air broadcasting with rabbit ears or some kind of antenna, patience is a must. You&#39;ll spend a fair amount of time getting the antenna in just the right positon to get all the channels, then a few days later, do it again.

Seems obvious I know, but it really needs to be pointed at the TV and not the general vicinity of the TV like most remotes.

walmart.com	over all, I consider this to be a good product. Picture quality is excellent and manuverability in menus is good. Only two things that I would like to see changed. When I turn the unit on, I would prefer to directly to my shows, not have to wait for the company logo to go away, and I still can&#39;t find the wake up time selection. I used my old TV as an alarm clock going directly to the Weather Channel. I now have to rely on an actual clock, even though this unit has a time clock in it.	5.0	11/30/2014

walmart.com	Ordered this T.V. from the website when our Element brand died after 2 years. We just wanted something cheap that would get he job done for now. For $210 I can&#39;t complain. The picture is adequate; sometimes it blurs a bit or has a line for a bit. The sound is much better than I expected. The sound is clear and generally the volume doesn&#39;t have to be too high to hear adequately. I think the sound quality does deteriorate the higher the volume goes up, but I&#39;ve heard that most flat screens have sound issues and that sound bars are generally needed to make them sound good. For a cheap tv it suits my needs just fine. I mainly using it for streaming video and watching DVDs. If you want a tv with amazing picture and features then spend the extra $$$ to get one. Otherwise, it works well enough if your needs are simple.	Toggle Search	11/25/2014
walmart.com	I didn&#39;t expect much from a $200 TV so I was very surprised and happy with the connections with this (eg. 3 HDMI) and the picture quality. You&#39;re still getting what you pay for, but at this price it is more than I feared it would be. Controls are easy, doesn&#39;t look cheap. Remote does feel cheap and sound is kind of hollow, but as a 2nd TV I don&#39;t care.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	12/4/2014
walmart.com	I shopped around for awhile,both online and in store and not just Walmart. I just couldnt justify the big jump in price from 720P to 1080I,so I finally bought the 32inch Sceptor from walmart.com.I ordered it on a monday morning and had it Friday afternoon!! for 229 dollars this is bar far one of the best deals ive found!! pictures great,sound is good,all the good gadget hookups and plenty of adjustments to make every one happy! also the ultra-slim freed up some more cabinet space! all in all a GREAT buy!!

walmart.com	I bought this TV on a hunch...knew nothing about the name or anything. It came very quickly to the store and I am very happy about that. I was shopping at WalMart when the text came that it was in. Upon getting it home, very easy to put together. Only problem that I had with the unit was the remote is garbage. I could not get it to do anything with the tv, replaced the batteries twice and still nothing. Called the number in the manual to find out that the remote has to be programmed to a Sony universal code. I tryed to program it to the code and it would not work. I went back out and bought another universal. This one programmed very easy so the remote that came with the tv is now a great paperweight. Picture is beautiful with an HDMI cable. Would buy it again. Just need to get the remote situation taken better care of.	Clear search field	12/3/2014

The only issue I have with mine is that when you have the TV&#39;s volume up pretty loud and a scream or other high piched noise occures the speaker and base of the TV starts to vibrate a bit, but I fixed that by using a different audio output (like a speaker system or speaker bar). Also another thing I like about this is that the options menu is very easy to access.	5.0	2/5/2015

It&#39;s one real shortcoming is it&#39;s audio output. The unit I have sounds extremely tinny and fuzzes badly with any base added to it so for audio quality I have to give it a big thumbs down. If you can get an inexpensive set of external speakers or if you have a surround sound system to connect it to you&#39;ll not find a better bargain.	4.0	2/10/2015

walmart.com	The one I bought is well worth the money. For the sound I have found that where you position it determines the sound quality. If it is in a corner then sound bounces off walls and you get a weak sound. The picture is no problem and you can change profiles or make your own. For $189.00 dollars it is going to be hard to beat. Yea it is not perfect but it did not cost a $1000.00 either. Not everybody likes the same thing and if they did there would only be one kind of TV any way.

walmart.com	I purchased this item on-line and wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. This has exceeded most of my expectations. The tv has a beautiful picture. The speakers are not the best for music or surround sound and this was my only con. I added a vizio sound bar and what a difference!!!! This tv has 3 hdmi connections, rca composite, and 2 different options for audio out. I think the remote is well balanced and has a solid feel. I have owned this for a few weeks and have been well pleased. I was not looking for 7.1 surround sound from the tv speakers, so it was not and issue. I would purchase this item again and recommend it to my friends.	Search	4/4/2015

walmart.com	We have a Sceptre 46&#34; that we bought a few years ago. The color in 46&#34; is vibrant. The 32&#34; color is bluish and washed out. Still the picture is clear, and considering the cost, it&#39;s an incredible deal. The sound isn&#39;t spectacular, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably even a little better than the 46&#34; Sceptre. So we&#39;re very pleased.	Invalid city, state or zip code	4/6/2015

walmart.com	I&#39;ve had the same TV since I was 7 years old so compared to a 16 yr old Orion television this is definitely an upgrade. A lot of people were commenting on the sound quality, but it&#39;s great. I&#39;ve been told I&#39;m deaf and I have to turn it down so that&#39;s saying something. I don&#39;t have HD but the picture quality is still nice. Probably would be even better with HD. I hooked my Xbox up and love it! Great TV for the price.	5.0	5/24/2015

walmart.com	Honestly for the price I paid for this television, it more than meets expectations. I&#39;m not a techie i any sense at all, I just needed a high def picture for my Wii exercise games :) My only complaint is that it doesn&#39;t keep time correctly. I set the clock and within a few days, it&#39;s off by several minutes. It&#39;s been about a month since I set it again, and it&#39;s running about 3 hours ahead....oh well.

walmart.com	I was a little skeptical buying the tv due to the price and some of the reviews, but so far it is working and looks great. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because even when the volume is turned all the way up it still is not very loud.	5.0	8/1/2015
walmart.com	This TV does the trick for me. I use it in my bedroom and have it connected to an HD receiver and my computer tower. ( I do not use the VGA port as i couldn&#39;t get a picture , I connected it to my computer using a DVI to HDMI cable. ) The picture quality on this TV is good. It&#39;s no top end 1080i picture, so dont expect a flawless picture if you have been spoiled by another. However the 720p picture quality i get from my HD channels is great. It took a little tweaking in the video settings to get the picture where i wanted it, and to be honest it wasn&#39;t good at all with the default settings. Spend some time in the menu system to calibrate the picture to your liking and i&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be disappointed with the end result. My only complaint so far is that the sound quality is a little flat, however with enough tweaking in the settings I did manage to get the sound to a pretty decent level. Overall this is a great TV for the price. You are not going to find many other TVs of this size at this price.	5.0	8/13/2015

walmart.com	For the price you pay for this TV it is a great value. Box shipped Fed EX got here before arrival date. rotating stand could be a bit sturdier but the swivel feature is nice. The batteries for the remote were dead had to replace those, but I was pleasantly surprised that the package came with a screen cleaner and screw driver for assembly of the product. I would however recommend this as a second or sports tv. picture is good as well as sound but viewing movies with a dark back round seems to be a challenge with a contrast ratio of only 3000:1 this is to be expected. Be aware of what you are purchasing and you wont be disappointed.	Menu	10/4/2011

I did have to call the help line to sort out the system for cable TV and had to call more than once. It almost seems as though the help is simply one or two people if that.

walmart.com	I got this on clearance, and I don&#39;t regret it for a single second. The picture quality isn&#39;t the best of the best, but I wasn&#39;t about to spend $500 on a new TV when I could get this for under $200. The sound is fine (I never turn up my TV too loud), and I love that it doubles as a PC monitor. I haven&#39;t checked out all of it&#39;s features, because I&#39;m only really using it for a little bit of TV, console gaming, and a second desktop monitor. So, if you just want a decent sized TV/monitor for your living room or bed room, this is a nice fit. But, again, I got it on clearance. I probably wouldn&#39;t have been as eager if I had paid full price.	5.0	12/17/2011

walmart.com	This is the second Sceptre I bought. The first one is a 46&#34;, second a 32&#34;. Extremely satisfied with these TV&#39;s. , especially seeing that they are dirt cheap. The 46&#34; I have in the living room and added a surround sound system, fabulous for watching movies. The second is in my work studio, could not ask for anything more. The sound is fine for news and regular programs, for movies it is not satisfactory but then neither is the 32&#34; size, that I have my 46&#34; for. Highly recommend this TV for the budget minded person.	5.0	12/27/2011

walmart.com	This TV is basically everything you could ever want for a simple LCD flatscreen. Being a gamer, most of the important TV features to me are picture, sound, and ports. The picture quality is great for the TV, just what you would expect from 720p with an HDMI cable. Xbox 360&#39;s work wonderful with the TV. There is no noticable input lag at all between the controller press and the action that takes place, and this TV has 2ms greater input lag than my previous HDTV. The only reason this didn&#39;t get 5* was because at times, the speakers sound a bit tin-ny, but considering the size of the speakers I suppose that&#39;s to be excepted. They are a fantastic quality though, they just can&#39;t properly create high-pitched sounds (from like orchestral choir, etc.). But this is a minimal issue, as I don&#39;t usually keep the volume past 12 (which is plenty loud enough to hear in a house filled with 4 little kids) and sounds that high usually aren&#39;t common. the other thing are the ports. While there is 2 or 3 (I forget) HDMI slots, there is only one a/v port....which only matters to some people. But as I play older game systems as well, its just a pain to switch it. However, its not something to not buy the TV over. Overall, this is pretty much the best HDTV I&#39;ve owned for the money.	5.0	12/28/2011

walmart.com	Ok, I admit it. I am not an electronics guru. I bought this for my 13 year old as a Christmas gift last year based solely on price. During the summer he played Xbox with his friends nearly every day. There are HDMI ports for easy connection. The sound is good, the picture is good. We did set this TV up in the living room earlier this fall when there were two good football games on at the same time. In the side by side comparison our regular living room TV picture was far superior, then again, it was far more expensive. Honestly, had I never seen the two TV&#39;s together, I wouldn&#39;t have even noticed. I really don&#39;t think this TV can be beat on a combination of features and price. You want more, then pay more. Otherwise, buy this TV. I think you will be happy. I intend to buy a 2nd one for our bedroom.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	12/31/2011

walmart.com	The picture is very clear and was bought at a great price for a basic TV without too many confusing bells and whistles. Don&#39;t consider the 720p versus 1080p/i as a problem as with this size screen I don&#39;t believe the average person could notice the difference. Has a sufficient number of inputs for about anything that may be needed to hook the TV up to including 3 HDMI ports but does not have a ethernet jack or wi-fi for connection to the internet. This TV was bought as a gift for a senior citizen with hearing problems. The sound is very clear and can be adjusted to a high level with no distortion. Has one feature where you can pause the screen temporarily using the enclosed remote that would be helpful if you wanted to review in detail what appears on the screen at a given time (the sound continues to proceed).

walmart.com	The picture quality of this TV is good, but the sound reminds you of a transistor radio. Anyone reading this that is old enough to remember how a transistor radio sounds will remember the &#34;tinny&#34; sound. Like you are in a metal barrel listening to the programs. Could make better use of computer monitor speakers for this system.	5.0	1/17/2012

However, I was glad to see that a majority of options on higher priced TVs were were available on this one. Absolutely recommend this TV if you want a flat screen with HD on a budget. The only complaint that I have is a sometimes touchy remote control.	4.0	1/21/2012

walmart.com	I would of really liked this tv. It was the lowest priced 32&#34; I could find. The only problem was when I received it there was not a stand in the box. I ordered on the Walmart site to store. Well I contacted site to store and they told me it did not come with a stand, but I brought it to their attention that the advertised tv showed a stand and the box said it came with a stand. I could of returned it and waited a week or so to receive a replacement but my local Walmart gave me another tv which cost alot more in trade for the no stand one. Kudos to Walmart of great customer service!	5.0	1/22/2012
walmart.com	An excellent value at the $179 refurbished price I paid. Yes. It does have a tinny sound that I was able to adjust enough to make palatable and not annoying. Must remember this is not a 1080p with 120 or more refresh rate. Even so; it has a very good hi def picture quality in my humble opinion. I would recommend this TV and in fact already have. Is an excellent bedroom or business unit.	5.0	1/24/2012

walmart.com	I honestly believe this is a Sony TV, just masking under another name. This is what they do to get there sales back up then the price of these TV&#39;s will eventually go up. Better get it why it&#39;s hot. Excellent TV and you absolutely can&#39;t beat the price. When I went to program my remote, it says follow the Sony settings, a very good indication that my beliefs are dead on..	5.0	1/24/2012
walmart.com	Nice set. Only one complaint. There needs to be more room around the coax connector and VGA port.	5.0	1/25/2012
walmart.com	My ancient Sony set blew up, and I ordered this on-line that night. It was delivered to my home 3 days later, set it up in 15-20 minutes and I was happily watching TV that night. The sound quality is fairly mediocre but the picture is quite good...though you need to fine tune it to your preferences. This set allows you to fine tune just about everything ( sound, picture, aspect etc) and it&#39;s easy to figure out, even if you aren&#39;t very electronic savvy, which is really nice, because I&#39;m not. I&#39;ll be adding a sound bar to improve the volume and sound quality, and you do have to buy a HDMI cable ( $14.00) if you have DirecTv, but for the money I paid for it ( $198.00) this set far exceeds expectations. I got the extended warranty just in case, since some reviewers had fatal function problems right away, but so far I&#39;m pleased with this whole deal. And this review site is what made me look at this relatively unknown brand in the first place...very helpful My only regret is that I didn&#39;t have the extra $100.00 to get the 42 inch model with 1080p (-:	5.0	1/25/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this television to replace one that was stolen. I purchased it during cyber week and I think it is a great deal for the price I paid. I had never heard of the brand Sceptre before and I&#39;m pretty impressed with it. The picture seems to be a little dull to me, but that may be due to having a digital converter and not cable hooked up straight to it. The setup for the TV was very simple and I like that it came with its own screwdriver and cloth to wipe the screen. I would definitely recommend this television if you are looking for something simple with not a lot of bells and whistles.	5.0	1/28/2012

Sleep timer requires you to push two buttons at the same time, which is sorta weird. Haven&#39;t played with many of the features yet.

walmart.com	We needed to replace our 2 year old flat screen that cost way more but we didn&#39;t get the service plan (or I couldn&#39;t find it anyways). Lesson learned there. This TV is 6 inches bigger for $100 less so we could afford a 4 year service plan. Size is perfect, set up is easy but takes a while to go thru the channels so be patient. Works with our cable box, DVD/VCR and Wii just like the old one. Picture is pretty good....seemed a bit dark at first compared to old TV, so I brightened it with the controls. Works with old Universal remote. Use Sony code as others have commented in the questions section. Sound is from the back so it sounds a bit muffled, which is the only thing I don&#39;t really like, but since this is for the kids play room, I can live with it for sure. I would hestitate to buy the same one for our bedroom or main living room because of the sound quality.	5.0	2/21/2012

On occasion I do hear a hum when no signal is present (before I go to the tuner or other active signal like DVD), but that is only when there is no signal so not that big of a deal. I ordered online for $180 and free shipping. Delivered to my door 3 days later. Overall very pleased for the price. If looking for quality video on a budget, this is a winner.	5.0	2/23/2012

walmart.com	The only reason I marked this as a 3 of 5 on meeting my expectations is because I&#39;m in Afghanistan, which doesn&#39;t use digital air waves so I needed an analog tuner. I saw this TV for $188 and jumped all over it. However, it has an NTSC analog tuner, which only works in the US (ironically, where there are no more analog broadcasts). Here they use the PAL standard, with which this TV is not compatible. I still recommend this TV based on value, picture, and sound quality. Just don&#39;t make the mistake I made if you live outside the US and think it will work without an external PAL converter box or DVD player with a built-in NTSC/PAL tuner.	4.0	3/10/2012

walmart.com	I bought this to replace an old analog TV that died. I knew I was taking a risk due to the price, but I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised. I&#39;ve had the TV for about a week now. It worked fine for a couple of days, but then the picture started showing interference. It had wide, horizontal bands of white &#34;snow&#34; in large flickering pixels. Over the next couple of days it got progressively worse to the point of being impossible to watch. I had seen a couple of reviews where the TV worked fine for a couple of days and then just stopped working, so I was worried I was going to have to return it and pay for a more expensive one, but I thought I&#39;d try replacing the co-axle cable first. I was using the one from the previous TV. I replaced the cable this evening and so far, so good. The picture is now clear with zero interference. Finger&#39;s crossed this will last. I&#39;ll update if I have problems. I do not have HD cable on this TV, so I can&#39;t really assess the picture quality. My mother says it isn&#39;t as crisp as her TVs where HD cable is connected, but it seems to be pretty good to me. As for the sound, it is loud enough and I do not hear any interference. I don&#39;t claim to have very sensitive hearing these days, however. I don&#39;t find there is a lot of control over the settings. They seem pretty limited. I think I went through them all as I was trying to clean up the picture as it declined. Overall, I&#39;m happy with my purchase. For $200, I got a 32&#34; flat screen. It is not a fine television by any standards, but it is certainly good enough for me. I&#39;m realistic enough to know that in a month, I could be singing a different tune, but for now, I&#39;d recommend this to others. If you are strapped for cash but you really want a flat screen, this is the TV for you. Or, if you need an extra TV for a guest room, etc., this TV will do fine.	5.0	3/21/2012

walmart.com	The only reason that I didn&#39;t give this tv five stars- a few months ago, I bought a 40 inch tv for the same price. It was the same brand, LCD- 1080p. I don&#39;t know why the prices have gotten jacked up- but- this is a great tv. The picture is crystal clear, unless you&#39;re sitting 2 ft. away or closer, then you do see some jagged areas. As far as the sound goes, there are actually settings that you can change in the menus on the 40 inch- not sure if this one has it or not, as it was a gift for my sister. I assume they most likely have the same settings though. If you go and read the reviews for the 40 inch, you will find a very helpful review of how to set up the sound quality settings for the best performance. As far as expectations, I wasn&#39;t expecting such a crisp picture, so that was great. Also, the weight of the tv- very light. Great tv!	Toggle Search	4/7/2012
walmart.com	I have had this for about 2 weeks. The remote is kind of an old design and the remote is very directional. The tuner is good with an amplified antenna I get about 20 digital stations in my urban area of St Louis. The sound is kind of tinny, it can be tweaked, but depending on the source it&#39;s loud and I&#39;ve had difficulty turning it down enough in the bedroom to be courtesy low. The picture can be dark depending on the movie but it&#39;s got me to be cable free with my Roku, Netflix and Hulu Plus in 720p in HD. Very pleased overall with the purchase. I got the extended warranty (which I usually never do) since the TV is cheap and $20 for 3 years is reasonably priced.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	4/7/2012

walmart.com	The picture is fairly poor(grainy and pixelated) but I don&#39;t have an HD box through DirecTV. It looks amazing with my PS3 with my HDMI cable. I just don&#39;t have the money to pay for an HD receiver and the picture quality isn&#39;t good with normal feed. Overall a great purchase for the price though!	Clear search field	4/12/2012
walmart.com	TV was easy to set up came with everything right down to the screwdriver.I very happy with my purchase and the price was great. The only thing I wish was that the base was taller that you could let it up I had to set it up on a box so it wouldn&#39;t be so low. All things aside its a great value and product.	Search	4/15/2012
walmart.com	I was impressed with the picture quality of this tv. I only have it hooked up to basic cable and not HD but the picture is still great! The only thing I was a little dissapointed with was that the remote doesn&#39;t seem to have a button to toggle between channels or go back to the last channel. Perhaps I just haven&#39;t figured out where it is yet.....	Items in cart	4/20/2012
walmart.com	Great Product for the money. The only downside is that the Audio out is not controlled by the tv volume. so you have to have volume control on your external speaker system.	Enter city, state or zip code	4/23/2012

walmart.com	This TV was bought to replace a very large CRT model. My hearing is going, badly, and, as well, I wanted something more up to date so I could use wireless headphones and not shake the walls of the house nor break the others&#39; ears if they were interested in watching the same show as I. This is last year&#39;s model and as such was available very inexpensively - 189 plus 10 shipping the monster, almost-30 pound package to my home in 2 days (standard shipping was only 5), which I consider impossible, given that I had to pay UPS 10 to ship a 6# item 30 miles recently - but, nonetheless, an outstanding bargain. The colors vary from source to source. The top news stations have the best color rendition and sound quality, but the movie channels and other minor cable channels have very irregular sound and color. I presume that to be a factor of production values, and not the set, but nonetheless, it was irritating by comparison to the CRT. The set has all the last-year&#39;s whizbangs, which means that I can stick a USB memory into the side of the unit and have a huge slide show of my pictures, or my videos. I&#39;ve not tried any of the other ports other than the earphone; it cuts the sound as would be expected - but I&#39;ll not be using a wired headset, anyway, so it doesn&#39;t matter. Unfortunately, my wireless headset hasn&#39;t yet arrived, so I can&#39;t actually comment on that function (RCA outputs), but I expect that it will be just fine. Overall, a great value.	5.0	4/30/2012

I didn&#39;t have a lot of money and spent a long time online looking for something i could afford. This was the cheapest 32&#34; I could find and it is ideal. The picture quality is good and it has all the features I needed, enough ports to connect the blu-ray, wii, etc. The sound isn&#39;t fantastic but more than enough to hear comfortably, it tends to be quieter when watching tv but louder when playing games or watching movies for some reason. All in all I would definitely reccomend this TV.	5.0	5/21/2012

walmart.com	I own and older model of this set and it worked great for many years. Then it started to take longer and longer to come on. The last time I turn it off it took 4 hours to come on, so i hooked it up to my sercurity system and it works fine and comes right on. Now for the new one sometimes i have to turn on and I get sound only and have then turn it off and then turn it back on and it works fine. So if little things like turning it on and off bother you, you should buy another brand. I am still fine tuning the picture to my liking and the sound is much better now that I moved it off the default setting. I purchased the 3 years warranty with this one so I am not looking to buy another soon.	5.0	6/8/2012

walmart.com	This is my second Sceptre TV. (I also own the next larger size.) Consumer Reports says the most important TV feature you should spend money on is its size. None of the other features comes close. So, both times we looked for the biggest TV for the money &amp; ended up with Sceptres each time. I&#39;ve had the first for a year &amp; it&#39;s great for the money. Ditto the second. I would almost say I don&#39;t know why anyone spends more except the sound quality of both Sceptres is really mediocre.

Mark threw me a gift card with the refunded price and then some. That proves:to talk to the man in charge&#34;. I didn&#39;t leave with a new tv, but I DID LEAVE HAPPY! I love my Walmart!

walmart.com	I recently purchased this TV, I was a little hesitant as I&#39;ve never heard as a Sceptre. Well this TV is great especially for the money, I purchased mine for $259.00 and it&#39;s excellent in my bedroom.The speakers aren&#39;t that great so I hooked up the TV to my sound system with external speakers and that took care of that problem. As I read through the guide book it says that this TV can be used with a sony remote so I presume it&#39;s made by sony. I liked this TV so much that I went out and purchased a 40 inch for my living room.I would recommend a Sceptre to to anyone. I forgot to mention that the picture on the TV is fantastic.	5.0	8/19/2012

walmart.com	I bought this TV for a bedroom and hooked it up to an antenna. I get great reception and a great picture. The TV stand was easy to attach to the TV and I had it assembled in just a couple of minutes. They even include a Phillips screwdriver in the box. The TV is attractive with a narrow case showing from the front. The sound is average with the sound coming from the bottom of the set instead of the front. There is plenty of volume to hear the sound over my treadmill running. I like the fact that this TV is lightweight and easy to move around. The plug to attach either cable or antenna faces downward. There is a separate area facing the left (looking from the front) with additional hookups, such as (1) USB and (3) HD, but not a place to attach cable or antenna there. I found this a little inconvenient, but it is a minor issue. Scanning for channels during set-up was easy using the quick set-up guide provided. I also tried hooking the TV to cable in another room and had good success with that too. The picture quality is very good for the price I paid. Overall I&#39;m very pleased with this TV in the 3 days I&#39;ve had it. I have watched it each day as I&#39;m on my treadmill. The remote is easy to use and batteries and a polish cloth were included in the package. I ordered this TV on a Friday morning, and it was delivered FedEx by the following Monday. Shipping was fast, and the package arrived in good condition. Walmart sent a timely shipping notification to me by email and I was able to track the package along the way. Great job Walmart and FedEx!	5.0	11/26/2012

walmart.com	I bought mine on line, on Black Friday. Used it for a week, and works well. I have my TV hooked up to a Verizon FiOS box, and to a Chromecast (since the TV has a USB port, I use that to power the Chromecast). Overall I am happy with the picture. I was worried about the 60HZ refresh rate, especially with fast moving video (like a sporting event), but have not seen any issues. The only draw back would be the sound. It plays well since my TV is in a cabinet and reflects the sound back to me. However it if was wall mounted, I would imagine you would need a sound bar. Summary: For the price (169.00) and free shipping it was a good purchase.	5.0	12/1/2012

It makes you search for the digital cable channels and I had to go through the set up a couple of times before I could actually watch TV (It could have been an oversight on my part). Once I got it set up everything appears to be gook. The picture quality is good, then again I am not a real stickler about that as long as its clear. However, I am still working on increasing the sound. It&#39;s a little low for my taste (hope I&#39;m not losing my hearing!) even with the volume all the way up. I didn&#39;t go into the menu and see if it was on stereo or not. I will check that and post again if that&#39;s the problem.

The only complaint is the speakers are a little tinny sounding, but not as bad as other Tv&#39;s I&#39;ve seen. Overall, this is a great tv, especially for $179. I added a google chromecast and it works great. The only complaint is with content providers not having apps for Direct tv. Also, to use the cast function from a browser, it has to be on a laptop, and not from android tablet.	5.0	8/30/2013

walmart.com	I have purchased three of this particular model tv, the first 2 years ago at $249 so at Walmart&#39;s current price it is a real bargain. I have had no problems with any of the tv, they all worked fine right out of the box. I must point out that you are buying a 720p tv and you get a picture as good as you can possibly get with this technology which more then meets my needs, however it is not a 1080p tv.	5.0	8/30/2013

I contacted support about the volume problem and there suggestion to solve this problem was for us to make an additional purchase of a sound bar to fix the low volume problem. The TV has been working fine other than the low volume problem. If you have young ears this is a great buy for this TV.	5.0	9/7/2013

walmart.com	I own 3 Sceptres. Never mind the 720P . Most people cannot tell the difference to 1080P I can&#39;t (I have both). BE SURE to get LED backlighting. That is the feature that separates the men from the boys. Much sharper picture. Sure the sound is not very good. Get a pair of USB powered speakers ( I got Altec Lansing )Nough said. Cost $14. Found out the plug in power source speakers have feedback--not pleasant. I have had my first 32&#34; set for 2 years---GREAT. My next 2 are 1 year and 2 months respectively. Most failures are within the first few weeks or months and you can take the set back. Sceptre is inexpensive and American. If they fail in a year or two, big deal. How much did you pay for the predecessor--$599 for a 27&#34; like me??? That&#39;s it I am well pleased.	5.0	10/30/2013

walmart.com	Arrived 5 days earlier than promised with free shipping. Easy to set up, even came with a magnetized screwdriver for assembly which is needed for 6 small screws for mounting the base. I am mainly using as a PC monitor. Good picture as TV or monitor. Less expensive than a lot of 24&#34; or smaller TV &#39;s. If you are planning to use with a PC you will need either a VGA or an HDMI connection cable not included. Easy to switch between TV and monitor with included remote.

walmart.com	Purchased this TV for use in bedroom. The price was very attractive. At 720 resolution, I was a bit skeptical that the quality would be good but was pleasantly surprised when I got it hooked up and started using it. The picture is very very good - sharp, no distortion. The speakers are on the low end and sound a bit &#34;tinny&#34; but for a bedroom TV, the sound is acceptable. No problems with setting up and getting it up and running. I will likely purchase another one for another spare room. It&#39;s only been in use for about 30 days, so I cannot comment on longevity, but it looks like a very good buy at least at this point.	5.0	2/24/2014
walmart.com	This TV looks good, was easy to set up, has plenty of connection options, and has good picture quality, but seems to have volume issues. We purchased this for the bedroom, and use it with a Roku box (NetFlix, Hulu, etc.). However, with the volume maxed at 100%, we still struggle to hear dialog at 8 feet away. The older TV we replaced with this model had no such issues, and we usually didn&#39;t have to go over 35% volume with that TV. We&#39;ll probably have to spend upwards of $100.00 on an external speaker system, which we don&#39;t really have room for, and could have just added that expense to the original TV cost and purchased a better model. Overall, we&#39;re happy with the TV for the price, but the volume issue will cost extra to resolve...	5.0	2/24/2014

walmart.com	Picture&#39;s good, size is perfect for our bedroom, and we love it. The only thing that we are not 100% satisfied with is the sound. It is not the best, and sounds like everyone is talking in a cave, but just slightly. Obviously not so bad that we don&#39;t enjoy movies. For the price, it&#39;s perfect!	5.0	3/13/2014

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my daughters dorm after the holidays. I was concerned about the brand, I never heard of it before. I did some research and found some of the parts are Sony brand. This was a positive aspect including the price. I read many of the customer reviews, the good and bad, decided for the price and the reason it was needed we should give it a try. It came with a small stand which had to placed on the TV. The screw driver was included, thankfully as we did not have one in her dorm room. The remote also came with batteries, forgot those too. The instructions were easy to follow and we were watching TV in about 10 minutes after the channels loaded. The picture clarity is not bad for something so inexpensive, and the first this we watched was football. I did not use it enough to say yes I would consider for my primary TV, but my daughter is enjoying a 32 inch in her dorm and she said it is great! I would recommend this product and will buy another in the future.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	3/24/2014

walmart.com	I bought this refurb needing best price for good TV. I had no hesitation with this relatively obscure brand because several years ago I bought a used PC that came with a Sceptre wide-screen monitor with DVI input and internal speakers which has been used constantly and still works flawlessly with incredible clarity and contrast. This Sceptre TV&#39;s picture is just as good, and I was pleased when, despite being a refurbished unit, Sceptre allowed me to register the purchase and extended the full factory warranty. I was, however, slightly disappointed with its less than full-feature control set, for example its USB input will only show pictures or play music; video files of any format not even detected (boo!). I mean, why even have a USB port? Its seemingly comprehensive remote control includes many buttons (1/3 of total) which are unassigned any function and cannot be used (boo!) Not even the buttons designated to control a SoundBar will function with a Sceptre (or any other) Soundbar. Finally, it is NOT a SmartTV, which I realized and I hope to connect a USB Chrome/Amazon/Roku or other stick so that Internet and WiFi streaming will become possible.	5.0	4/10/2014

walmart.com	Excellent picture, size. USB port however is not friendly to Mac Users. Drives have to be formatted as Windows FAT 32, not Mac Format. And while Mac can format drives as Windows FAT 32, it creates hidden files which the Sceptre Tv tries to read and then lists as &#34;cannot display.&#34; There is a work around, but it is quite tedious. You have to find the hidden files using Terminal, then delete them in terminal. Google for directions.	5.0	8/1/2014

A little gray at the extreme corners of the picture, the clock doesn&#39;t keep accurate time, it turns itself off after 10 minutes (it&#39;s suppose to) but it doesn&#39;t turn itself back on when the computer is turned on or brought out of screensaver; nevertheless, it was a good purchase!

Its got all the features from HDMI to USB input to VGA, which means you could watch moves straight from your Flash drive or connect your laptop to the TV using a VGA cable and you could use it as a big screen and watch things of the net. The sound is somewhat low and needs a higher volume, however if use a Sceptre Soundbar that problem is taken care off and you can also use your TV remote for the soundbar as it is incorporated in the TV remote.

After a couple days, the picture would start flickering and flashing on and off after being on for about 15 minutes and then it would be fine after that. I decided to return it and I&#39;m trying out the LED version of Sceptre because it had better reviews although it was about $30 more. Hopefully this one works better.

walmart.com	I connected this set via an HDMI cable from my satellite system. The picture was great, and the sound was adequate, when it worked. After watching for about 30-40 minutes, the sound was just cut off. If you turn the set off and then on again, the sound would return, for another 30-40 minutes. The phone call to Tech Support was a joke. The technician (same guy, 2 days in a row) suggested I use the component connection, and my Dish box does not have component outputs, so he suggested I try the AV outputs. This seemed to resolve the sound problem, along with a loss in picture quality using a single video plug versus the HDMI connection. That solution was completely unsatisfactory for a TV less than 2 weeks old. If you can get a set that works, it was well worth the price, but I was unwilling to continue to take chances with trying a replacement set. I exchanged it at Wal-Mart for a slightly pricier, but more dependable set.	5.0	11/28/2014

The sound quality is not that great and the television vibrates audibly on low end (bass) tones in the sound. If you are hooking it up to a stereo system (and external speakers) for your audio, this won&#39;t be an issue since the sound won&#39;t be coming from the TV. For me, the sound problem takes my overall rating from 4 stars to 3.	5.0	12/11/2014

I have to the remote placed at the right spot towards the tv in order for it to anything.

I figured oh I am sure it is fine. The tv really does not get very loud though. I am now looking into purchasing a sound bar system to go with it even though it is only for a bedroom.

walmart.com	I needed new TV, and with plans to use this TV in a living room within the next year, I figured, why not buy this one? The deal was fantastic for Black Friday. The stand on the TV is wobbly. Luckily my TV isn&#39;t placed in an area of high traffic, nor is it anywhere someone could knock it, but it makes me a little wary. The sound is... interesting. It&#39;s a loud TV. With the volume as low as it possibly can be, I can sit down and hear the TV perfectly. Great for some, not great if you&#39;re using this TV to fall asleep to. Also, the sound is a little &#34;tinny&#34; to me... it has that tin-can echo. Like someone else mentioned, I fiddled around with the general sound settings and EQ, but it can get a little annoying to do over and over. It does have a fair amount of options for picture and sound, but less than what I&#39;d gotten on my old 22&#34; Emerson TV. So far, I&#39;m not too impressed with the picture, but I&#39;m not watching any HD channels, and I haven&#39;t watched a blu-ray on it yet. So, for basic cable, it&#39;s just... you know, big. So, for the price, it&#39;s definitely worth it, and I&#39;m grateful for that. Is the TV exceptional? No, it definitely suffers a bit from the &#34;bigger is better&#34; problem plaguing technology right now.	5.0	12/23/2014
walmart.com	I purchased (2) 32&#34; Sceptre Flat Screen TV&#39;s on 11.28.2012... The picture quality is awesome... especially because of the poor vision that both my husband &amp; I have. The only thing that I am disappointed in is the sound.. the volume quality. It definitely was not what I expected. I turned the volume all the way up and for me, it seemed low. I called the mfg. and they told me that I needed to purchase a &#34;Sound Bar&#34; from any electronics company. I called Best Buy and they told me that the &#34;Sound Bar&#34; cost anywhere from $149 to $500. You know my mouth was hanging open! Maybe sometime next year I will be able to purchase a &#34;Sound Bar&#34; but that&#39;s still disappointing to me.	5.0	12/24/2014

walmart.com	The Shipping was Excellant...Very Fast Good Service. The picture is basically ok.. Crisp and Clear. The Sound is Great. I&#39;ve only had it about two weeks now, but everything seems to work as it should. The only weekness I see is that the color could be improved upon, and a smaller remote couldn&#39;t hurt. It&#39;s not that the color is horrible, it&#39;s that tv&#39;s I have had in the past compensated better the color from one channel to the next. With this one, at least in my opinion, changing from one channel to another, the color intensity is not uniform. Other than that, I think it&#39;s a very nice tv, at a good price..	Menu	12/24/2014
walmart.com	Still like the television, unfortunately mine has started to act up! Some days you have to turn on and off the remote 4 to 5 times or more, just to get the television to come on. Now today the picture has started to go in and out while playing. Contacted Walmart since I had bought the extended warranty. good thing I bought it, since I originally purchased 11/04/2011. Now the bad news, under the warranty, they are sending me a shipping label, and I have to mail back in the original box( yes I kept mine) make sure you keep yours, it is part of the warranty. Now I will be without a television for 5 - 10 days. I think that at this price, they should just send you a new television to the store, and have you bring the broken televison in for exchange. Oh well, will see how the warranty people work on getting it back. May make me think about purchasing another televsion. When you are on disability, it is difficult to come up with an extra $200 for a tv.	Toggle Search	12/25/2014

walmart.com	We were so excited to get a TV for the price. The big issue is the picture quality is poor and no matter what adjustments I make it seems out of focus and the color isn&#39;t brilliant. Looks faded. Also I cannot seem to hook up our DVD player no matter what cables I put in which RCA slots. So this has been frustrating at this point. I was excited when I read about the manufacturer and their development history, but now I don&#39;t know if I will buy another product from this vendor.

walmart.com	The unit&#39;s maximum sound volume is lower than expected. Connecting my HD Player via the HDMI connector presented &#39;no sound&#39; issue. Switching to the VCR connector presented additional sound issues - the VCR connection shares the sound connectors with the YPbPr connector [which is connecting my VCR/DVD player] causing me to have to &#39;physically&#39; switch cables between them to have sound.

I had to contact Sceptre and they had me fill out an RMA request form via their website and wait 72 hours.

walmart.com	We bought this online and picked it up at the store. Upon getting home it set up easily and looked great (a big improvement over our old tube tv) :). Unfortunately, within about 10 minutes the screen suddenly went black. We could hear the sound and change channels, but no picture. I called tech services and they said it was a motherboard issue and would need repair or replacing. Since I just bought it, they recommended returning it to the store and getting a new one. We took it back with no problem but the same model was out of stock to reorder so we ordered the higher pixel version of Sceptre. We have had no problems with the new one. So, in summary, unless you get a dud (reviews indicate the black screen is the most common problem but doesn&#39;t happen often), this is a good value for the money.	5.0	12/31/2014

Overall it is a good set for the money and it works very well. the stand it sets on is too light and flimsy, could easily fall over if rocked too much.

They state there is a 24 to 48hrs turnaround time for someone to reach out; however, it is going a week with no contact from Sceptre reps.

Started having issues with the monitor turning off and on after 1st year, would have to try several times To turn the power on via remote or manually at least once a week. Now, 1 year and 10 months after purchase the display/monitor is completely kaput! Just went bad one day with Flickers and flashes on the screen. Did not purchase warranty. Friend of mine bought exact same model from different retailer and same happened to hers after about 1 1/2 years.

walmart.com	I think this a good buy when you are on a budget and aren&#39;t a electronic buff. My only complaint is that the sound quality is pretty bad. Especially when you have it on twenty and you can still barely hear. This comes from a girl who hates when my other TV is on anything above 8. Otherwise it is a good buy. I would recommend a sound bar.	Search	1/27/2015
walmart.com	I thought this would be an inexpensive TV to fit our needs but ended up returning it for two reasons... #1 Sound was way too quite. I used it while running on my treadmill and couldn&#39;t hear the TV even with the volume all the way up. #2 There was a big vertical line all the way through the TV that would not go away. Set up was easy and Walmart let me return it for a full refund. I probably could have exchanged it for another TV that would not have had the line through it, but would still have been disappointed with the lack of volume.	Items in cart	1/28/2015

walmart.com	This has been a good tv for the several weeks I&#39;ve had it and if you&#39;re concerned about buying a 720p rather than a 1080p you really can&#39;t tell the difference on a 32&#34;. I bought the tv because I needed something affordable and I am pleased with my purchase. The only downfall (as with any cheap tv) is the sound quality. To be completely honest it sucks. I bought a set of Bose speakers to compensate and you would never know I got it all for under $200. Pros: Good value, Easy setup, Good picture quality (with some minor adjustments) Cons: Horrible sound quality, The ugly &#34;LED TV&#34; sticker in the top left corner In summary I am pleased with my purchase so far and would recommend it to a friend along with a set of speakers	5.0	2/1/2015
walmart.com	I personally have a smaller one of these. They are fine for what you pay but sound is a bit &#34;tinny.&#34; One thing to note is that the speakers face somewhat downward so it is better if attached to the wall as opposed to sitting on a stand, as speakers will sound &#34;muffled.&#34;	5.0	2/1/2015

walmart.com	My kids got me this TV for Christmas. I was very excited and loved everything about it. After a week, I had a problem with the sound. There was no audio. I called DirectTV not knowing if it was an issue with the remote and a button being indivertibly pushed. The only thing that got the sound back was to unplug the TV. However, after a short amount of time (minutes) the audio would go off again. We have to take the TV back and get a new one. Of course this is a pain because we had to plug the old TV back in and take the TV back and redo the whole process again. So not really happy with this part. But when the TV worked, I loved it.	5.0	2/15/2015

Sometimes not at all for 2-3 days, other times 1-2 times a day. Since it was easy to program the Direct TV remote to work the TV, when it switches it&#39;s self to HDMI 2 I have to find the TV remote to switch it back (then rewind to where it switched off). Would be very annoying if I couldn&#39;t rewind. HDMI 1 is the only connection used in my setup and remote is put away to eliminate an accidental switch.	Toggle Search	6/7/2015

walmart.com	Got this for a family Christmas present to replace an old Sceptre (that we loved but had begun having issues), and had to take it back. The price was great and Walmart.com site to store shipping was pretty quick but the box was a little dented around the edges. When we plugged it in at home we had issues with the sound quality, everything sounded tinny and the TV would vibrate with certain frequencies (maybe this is because the speakers come out of the bottom?). This seems to be a problem with many of the new slim flat-screen LCD&#39;s though, so it&#39;s hard to say if it was damaged or just of poor quality. The picture quality was good, no complaints about that. After the first use, the TV also began making a &#34;clunking&#34; noise when we would turn it on or off. Sorry Sceptre, but you&#39;ve lost a customer until you work out your sound issues :(	5.0	6/26/2015
walmart.com	I purchased this TV due to the great reviews I read however, when we got it home, I was disappointed.

walmart.com	First of all, I have this tv only one week. While the sound is good, the picture quality is realllllllllllllllllllllly bad. It’s fuzzy and I couldn’t fix it no matter how many adjustments I made. My 7 years Apex tv (which was an old school btw) had a better picture quality than this. I’m VERY disappointed and now I can’t even watch my favorite tv shows because this tv gives me a headache. The reason I bought it is because of the price since my budget is very tight and most of the reviews where nice, which was misleading obviously. So, if you really want a tv that offers good quality picture &amp; sound, then I guess you must be willing to pay a little more. That is exactly what I am going to do; take this tv back to the store and exchange it with better one, like Sony/Samsung or even Vizio.	5.0	7/7/2015

walmart.com	All in all the TV was just ok. I called Scepter to get some technical support because from the time I plugged in the TV there was &#34;snow&#34; on the screen, and nothing I did would get rid of it. When I called them I couldn&#39;t even talk to a live person, the only option I was given was to leave a message; so that&#39;s what I did. A week went by with no return call, so I called and left another message this time providing my work number in addition to my home number. I never heard back from them. Frankly it was mostly the lack of customer support to help me work through the problems that I got fed up with; I ended up returning the TV.	5.0	7/17/2015

walmart.com	This was my first online order through Walmart.com. I also used site to store pick up which both of these experiences were good. BUT once we got the TV home and opened the box to set TV up very important parts were missing...power cord, remote, swivel base to attach tv to the base and any manuals. We tried to call their 1-800 number and were on hold going through prompts, then chose to log in to their online customer service. After explaining what was missing they promised to ship them the next day. We received them in good time. While setting the tv up we found that the power cord is very tight and had trouble getting it to turn on. After working with it for a bit was able to get the television to power up. We are happy with the television once we got past the original problems.	5.0	8/26/2015
walmart.com	Purchased this mainly for use with my game console. Set up was pretty easy and the TV came with a miniature screw driver. I was a little bothered by the stand though, as the TV would wobble a good deal when touched (and yes, I made sure the screws on the mount were tightened). It was great until I started playing a darker-themed game, and I noticed a few dozen pixels were dead. I thought it was a scratch at first, until I looked closer, and after noticing it, I just could not look past it. Sound was great -- in fact, I tend to like my volume low, and had to keep it at a 1 so I didn&#39;t feel like I was blasting out my neighbors. Aside from the pixel issue, the picture was pretty good, but I just couldn&#39;t stand the defect. I brought it back to my store the following day with the intention of purchasing another, until a customer told me she&#39;d purchased the same exact TV. She told me she&#39;d actually purchased two for use in her restaurant (only open for four hours at a time), and both TV&#39;s stopped working within 2-3 months of the purchase date. After hearing that, I decided against trying again.	5.0	8/27/2015

walmart.com	Due to the low price, I purchased this TV for my home office and am very disappointed. I knew that if I bought an off-brand there would some sort of trade-off. A few years ago, I bought a 42&#34; Insignia for my living room and am very pleased with it, so I assumed this TV would be of that quality. Not so. The sound quality is very&#39; tinny&#39; and the picture, well - its darkish, not bright and colorful and no matter what I do to adjust it, I cannot fix either. If you don&#39;t really care about picture &amp; sound quality and want cheap - buy this TV. But for a few dollars more, you can get a top brand TV with sound and picture to go with it.	5.0	9/5/2015
walmart.com	This TV is, first of all, incredibly well priced – that is an undeniable fact. However, I bought it 5/5/12, and 5 days ago on 3/28/13, it died; did not quite make it to a year. I do still have audio, but no picture at all, no manufacturer&#39;s graphic overlay (e.g., guide, menu, settings), nothing. I turned it on and there was a &#34;pop&#34; and then nothing but sound. I would not recommend it, and I am sincerely hoping that the manufacturer&#39;s 1-year warranty is actually useable. I have purchased a 32” Phillips to replace it, hopefully I will have better luck with this unit – but bought the 3-year warranty just in case :P	5.0	9/5/2015
walmart.com	Sound isn&#39;t too good. I had to turn it up high to hear it and the tv vibrates because of it. The stand isn&#39;t stable so the tv wobbles. The only nice thing about it i can say is the picture is good. The tv blew out 8 months after i got it. If you still wanna risk it get the warranty on it when it breaks down but who wants to go though that. Don&#39;t believe those good comments on this page because i did and look what happened.	5.0	9/7/2015
walmart.com	I bought this TV late November 2012 and the picture lasted 7 months and died! I tried to get a Return Authorization from the Sceptre website and it doesn&#39;t even work. Don&#39;t buy this TV no matter how cheap the offer it. You will regret your purchase.	5.0	9/8/2015
walmart.com	I bought the TV, it worked well for 11 month1 week (under warranty) then the picture flickered out and in. Trying to contact Sceptre by phone, your almost out of luck, email will take a few days if your lucky also, they replaced it, I received it back after 2 weeks 3 days, opened it, and turned it on and found that the screen was broke, so... had to repeat trying to contact them, and I guess it&#39;s in the mail. Bottom line... the customer service is less than sub standard in my book	5.0	9/9/2015

walmart.com	I purchased my TV November 2012. I have had it 13 months and it has already quit working. I have no sound or picture. The TV light turns blue to indicate the TV is ON and when I try to shut the TV OFF it doesn&#39;t shut off the TV with the remote or by using the Power button. I have to unplug the TV to get it to turn off. I have a friend whose TV only lasted 4 months. His was still under warranty but he lived in Virginia at the time and it was quite a bit of money to return to California so he just purchased another brand of TV. If you Google Sceptre televisions you will be able to read some other horror stories about this TV.	5.0	9/17/2015
walmart.com	Everything about this TV seemed great but it only lasted 10 months. The TV won&#39;t power up, When you turn it on both blue lights appear but no picture so basically my $180 bargain only lasted me 10 months......I certianly didn&#39;t expect it to last forever, but expected it to at last at least a couple of years.	5.0	9/18/2015
walmart.com	This TV is mediocre but the price is great. I ordered it online and had it shipped to the store. I picked it up yesterday and I&#39;m returning it today. As soon as I attached it to the stand and turned it on, the first thing I noticed was that there was a small green dot that was compromising the video quality of the screen. So one of the pixels was not generating a picture. It becomes more evident if the screen fades to black or if you&#39;re watching a nighttime or low lit scene in a movie or TV show. This doesn&#39;t help the fact that the video quality is already less than stellar in the first place. The picture appears grainy and it looks like you&#39;re viewing an analog channel on a digital TV. The next problem is the sound quality. When the sound is on and a show is playing, there doesn&#39;t appear to be any problems with the sound. If you&#39;re using a DVR and you pause the playback, eventually the TV makes a repetitive scratching sound. I went up to the TV to make sure that&#39;s where the sound was coming from and I put my hand on the back of it. I could feel the vibration coinciding with the noise that was coming from the TV while the DVR was paused. Then after it went on for a while, it started getting louder! This was all within two hours of taking it out of the box. You really get what you pay for, I&#39;m going to exchange it for a better TV and pay a little extra like I should have in the first place.	5.0	9/22/2015
walmart.com	I got this TV November 2012 and it was great at first, that&#39;s why I rated it two stars instead of 1. In October 2013, the screen stopped working and the TV would not turn on. I contacted customer service and have sent it out to them to fix/get a new tv. I will update once I receive the new one.	5.0	9/26/2015
walmart.com	I bought this for my son&#39;s room so he could play his Xbox with friends. I did not bring cable tv into his room so the tv was hooked directly to the Xbox using the directions provided. So nothing on our end could contribute to the fact that the tv just died after 15 months. Thankfully I bought the extended warranty so let&#39;s see what they can do. I&#39;ve plugged it into another outlet, still a black screen, hooked it up to my cable tv and just a black screen. So we bought a Vizio and if this one gets working I have a new tv. But I have a feeling it won&#39;t be for long.	5.0	9/27/2015

walmart.com	This TV was bought for our office, and it would be used on occasion for TV watching and also for our grandchildren to play video games on. After hooking it up I found the picture and sound quality to be far below what I would have accepted. I ended up paying about $50 more and got a LG 32&#34; TV which has been perfect in every way! In our home we already have a 50&#34; LG and a 37&#34; Vizio and love them both. Maybe I&#39;m just spoiled for what I feel is good quality. I knew I wouldn&#39;t be happy with the Sceptre, so paying a little bit more was well worth my TV enjoyment...	Items in cart	10/2/2015

walmart.com	This is a fair bargain for the price. The picture is good and it&#39;s an easy set up and light weight. Only draw backs are the sound and the occasional HDMI port input change. The sound in extremely poor. I had to hook up to a surround system to be able to adjust the volume to levels where I could actually hear the programming. There have also been a couple times that the tv changes input for no apparent reason (ex. HDMI 1 to HDMI 2). That one puzzles me. Occasionally, the sound will go out completely if I am watching something on DVR and switch back to reg tv. That is fixed when I change channels. Overall for the price, you can&#39;t beat it if you have a sound bar or audio system you can connect to it.	5.0	12/23/2014

walmart.com	Decent TV for price, but the old say &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; rings true for this one. The picture is OK but the volume is pathetic. The speakers are on the bottom of the TV so if you simply want to use the TV stand and not a wall mount, you can barely hear the TV (even when turned to 100% of its capacity). I bought it for my mother for Christmas so was unable to get home to check on it for her until Feb (she lives in Alabama, I live in Seattle). I contacted Septre for technical support. They said (after only owning the TV for 2 months) that I would need to package it up and ship it back to them at my own expense for them to troubleshoot and repair. Not satisfied at all.	4.0	2/6/2015
walmart.com	Bought TV online at Wal-Mart.com was weary because I had never heard of the brand. Packaging was very good a lot of time went into the packing of the tv and accessories. The tv looked great and I was pleased with the ease of assembly. They even supplied a screwdriver to install the stand which was a nice touch. However....the top half of the screen went black as I started the channel search and never resolved. Just half of the screen went dead. So I ignored the do not return to store statement on the instructions and returned it to Wal-Mart the next day for another brand I had never heard of as this brand is not carried in stores. New tv not as nice looking but has a great picture so I am pleased that the return process was easy.	4.0	2/8/2015
walmart.com	I bought this to use as an external monitor when my laptop screen went on the fritz. Works great for that purpose for as long as it lasted, but the screen died after just 16 months of use. That&#39;s right - just four months after the warranty expired. I did my due diligence and read as many reviews of this TV as i could find, and all praised the picture quality, but i wish I could have found some by people who had owned it more than a few months.

walmart.com	The Sceptre 32&#34; Class LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV (X322BV-HD) didn&#39;t work out of the box. The screen came on for a split second then went black. Apparently, if you take it apart, remove a couple of capacitors from the power supply, and replace them with better ones it will work for a while (average of a couple months). I decided to not take a brand new TV apart to see if I could fix it. I exchanged it at my local Walmart for a 32&#34; Element HDTV.

I returned it to Walmart - IN STORE and recommend anyone else who has this problem to do so as well.. don&#39;t bother shipping it back, just get the receipt and take it to customer service... they will refund or exchange it.

walmart.com	We just purchased this tv for our 9yr old son for Christmas, to replace his perfectly working, smaller one. Once hooked up, it had little squiggly lines running across the screen, which eventually cleared up. We weren&#39;t sure if it was the tv, or a problem with the cable, because we were actually having issues with that at the time also. But oddly enough, the tv started turning ON by itself. We would turn it off, and 5 minutes or so later, it would just pop right back on. Every time, its a different amount of time....and POP, right back on !! Very disappointed... nobody wants a tv that turns on by itself at various times of the day or night. You want it to turn OFF ... when you want it to.... not surprise you and just POP on !	5.0	4/20/2012
walmart.com	Unfortunately I had to return this item on 2/27/12. It was a Christmas gift for my son. After two days it started having horizontal lines appear at the bottom of the screen.

I feel bad that I did not have this same experience. I did have high hopes!	5.0	4/24/2012

walmart.com	This TV worked great for only 1 month! Then while watching a show, it went totally blank. I tried exchanging at the local store but the Sceptre brand is only sold online.

walmart.com	This TV&#39;s picture wet black after a couple months of having it. You get what you pay for here. The price was low because the quality was low. I was able to return it to the manufacture to have it fixed under the manufacturer&#39;s year warranty I sent it back a week and a half ago and will not receive it for approximately 3 weeks. The warranty is good if it blacks out under a year but it will take a whole month to have it shipped, fix and returned. Customer service was horrible. This whole purchase was a nightmare! If i could give this TV no stars rather than 1 I would. NEVER AGAIN.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	6/26/2012
walmart.com	Purchased in June 2012. First one failed right out of the box, with a long line of pixels turned on white permanently. Exchanged in store. Second one just failed with a &#34;pop&#34; sound as I turned it on, a terrible smell, and actual smoke out the top. This is March 2013. I used it as a secondary tv in the bedroom, so it really didn&#39;t get much use. I figure I turned it on maybe 25-30 times total in 9 months. Really no excuse for this. I&#39;ll have to pass on Sceptre next time around.	Clear search field	6/30/2012
walmart.com	This Sceptre TV seemed like an awesome deal but if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is true. This TV suddenly stopped working after 4 months of daily use. Up to that point it was very good. I did purchase the additional warranty so if you buy a Sceptre, be sure to purchase the warranty. I probably bought a lemon as the other reviews are mostly positive.	Search	7/8/2012
walmart.com	Im a college student and I bought this TV for my new apt back in July so its almost been a year since I&#39;ve had it...it was a GREAT buy initially until last week it rained really hard and all of a sudden the TV picture has gone black. Ive tried resetting the TV (unpluging cables) and nothing has worked. I contacted Sceptre because technically Im still &#34;covered&#34; by the company&#39;s one year warranty...well apparently labor fees and shipping on this size of a TV is well over $250...I didn&#39;t even pay that much for the freakin TV?? So...needless to say Im urked. Im all about finding mere quality vs name brand but honestly your better off just investing in a Sony or something. This TVs are known to start well and finish stupid and thats why its so cheap.	Items in cart	7/8/2012

Eventually, the television shut itself off and will no longer show a picture in the screen when turned on.

walmart.com	Very disappointed. We bought this 32&#34; Sceptre from Walmart.com in May of 2012 for occasional use in the bedroom. We received it on 6/1/2012. It quit working today (June 21, 2013). The picture flashes on and off, one time displaying half of the screen for a second, then back off. It occasionally displays a red horizontal line across the middle for a second or so. We normally expect a TV to last more than three weeks beyond the warranty period.	5.0	9/18/2012
walmart.com	We got this TV as a Christmas gift, it was not hooked up until after New Years. No matter what we did the color and picture were always off and the sound varied. Not long into February the jacks in the back to hook the game system and dvd player into came loose and the connection would short out. If anything is on the screen (like a title screen of a movie or wii menu) for any length of time the image is &#34;burned&#34; into the screen and you will see it even as a new show plays. I am now attempting to return this waste of money. I guess it is true you get what you pay for	5.0	10/5/2012
walmart.com	The power board failed after 18 months of moderate use in our bedroom. The company wanted $100 to replace the power board and $50 for shipping and handling.

These blow out anytime between 90 days (for one of them) and 12 months (for 2nd one purchased). You cannot get ahold of their warranty department, the phone number just rings off the hook!

walmart.com	We bought this TV for my grandson for Christmas 2012. By May, audio was out... no sound from internal speakers, external speakers, headphones, etc. It was under warranty, so we sent it in for repair. It was returned after 1 month with the audio repaired. Now, after another month of use, the picture and audio is out... nothing works except the &#34;on&#34; light. We are sending it back again for repair, still under warranty, but we do not have any confidence in the product. I would not be surprised if it has more problems before the end of the year. On the plus side, their customer service has responded to my emails within a few days (for the most part). And, since the TV is still under warranty, it has not cost us anything to repair. Maybe we just got a &#34;lemon&#34;, but after a quick review of other reviews, it seems that this model has a high percentage of catastrophic failures. My recommendation would be to avoid this TV and buy a name brand.	5.0	12/1/2012

walmart.com	I received this as a gift. I was disappointed with it being from this retailer and heard bad reviews of this brand line. The sound quality is awful unless you have a surround sound. These style TVs aren&#39;t built to last, so do yourself a favor and pick up the extended warranty for this one or buy elsewhere. That competing big box wholesale store has TVs at a slightly higher price point with MUCH better warranty of 2 years for all TVs and an additional 3 years on top of the 2 for less than $50. Great bargain unless you want it to last for more than 20 months. The features are pretty solid and the picture quality itself was good enough -until it stopped working.	5.0	12/21/2012

Keep in mind,not the most expensive.With that said,the sound quality isn&#39;t that great, and after a few months ,the sound complety went out and we had to return it.

From what I read over the weekend, this is a common theme with all buyers of this brand of TV. I&#39;m so disappointed. The value was great that was the main appeal but I&#39;m disappointed for falling for value over quality. Who wants to replace a TV after only 16 months? From what I&#39;ve read it will cost more to repare it rather than just replace it. Do not buy unless you dont mind replacing your electronics every 15 - 18 months. If I would have known, I wouldnt have even bought this for my child.	5.0	11/22/2013
walmart.com	while the picture quality was pretty good , the sound tends to be tinny....used it as a monitor for my pc..which was satisfactory. Had the product for less than a year when the on off switch began to have problems, until finally it failed to turn on the screen. There aren&#39;t any local places to take it for repair. It has to be sent back to the factory. I had called the Company and they said it was likely a failed circuit board. I don&#39;t have my purchase documents so will likely just trash it and buy something better..	5.0	11/23/2013
walmart.com	Have had about a year. TV will power on but screen will not turn on. Have to unplug &amp; replug more &amp; more to get screen to come on! JUNK TV!!	5.0	1/28/2014
walmart.com	I purchased two of these TV&#39;s. Neither made it through the first year. Sceptre customer service is not customer oriented or friendly at all. They do not provide you with details on whether the TV is services or replaced. They avoid any pertinent questions or concerns and refuse to accomodate for the inconvenience. Each time the TV malfunctioned we went 1 - 3 months without a TV. The first unit we purchased in 2012 and have been through 4 units. We have finally decided to throw in the towel and purchase a new TV and never again buy a Sceptre product.	5.0	3/21/2014
walmart.com	I stupidly bought 3 of these things ,the 1st ones screen went black in less than 8 weeks,the 2nd one in 27 days and this last one you can&#39;t hardly get the power button to work, sometimes it takes up to 10 times of disconnecting it and hitting the power button again to get it to come on,but I know its only a matter of time before it will completely stop working. I should have paid attention to the reviews could have saved myself a lot of time,trouble and aggrevation. Never will I buy this brand again, even if they have a 5 for the price of 1 sale.	5.0	3/31/2014

walmart.com	We bought several of these tvs and half of them made it passed three months. The picture would go out but sound was still there and we spent $75 plus dollars to fix them. So these tvs are were no help to us and now we have to replace them not even a year later.	5.0	7/25/2014
walmart.com	There is not a manufacturers code to set this up with my cable box. I have to use 2 remotes and if I forget which one to use for what, I have to start over. Instructions only cover &#34;without a cable box.&#34; The sound is awful, not anything like what I expected. It is tinny and not at all what I exected. What the heck did I buy????? I thought I was getting a good deal and a new TV, but this is not at all what I expected. I do not like it, but it would cost me more to return it....let&#39;s just say I am not happy and prefer to just keep it off than turn it on and listen to the silence. I hate it. What did I buy here?	5.0	11/30/2013

We took the TV to a Walmart back and thanks to their great exchange service, picked out anoyher TV. It was another brand, I had to pay addl. $ 21 because of the price diffrence. This TV is not sold in our local Walmarts. But I am happy now.	Menu	12/5/2013

walmart.com	I bought this TV for my mom, after years of not having a new one, after reading the reviews. I figured since the majority of the reviews held this TV in high regard, I figured I&#39;d go for it. However, I regretted that decision the minute the TV was hooked up. TV picture was god awful!!! And the sound quality was even worse (maybe because the speakers are facing underneath the TV???). My mom&#39;s 20 year old tv had better picture and sound then this TV. Returned it to the store after 1 day! Going to buy a Vizion 32inch which has been rated one of the best TVs buy CNET and PCMag.

flipkart.com	  I was indeed happy when i got this product delivered the next day and within a few days it was installed. Then the tv worked for 15 days. I was outstation for a week and when i returned it was not working. Then contacted micromax people and they came and took the tv to their repair centre in Mumbai. They told me, since it is an online purchased item, the item has to go to Delhi and will take time of one month to get it repaired. Now it is more than a month and I am still waiting. The local respresentative of Micromax is not taking my phone when I call. .. what a nightmare business. the local Micromax people says: DONT BUY ONLINE... 	1 star	  19 Aug 2014

flipkart.com	  i ordered my tv and got this product on promise date but the problem is when i received the product i was told that a guy would come for installation within 48 hours. its almost 10days no one has turned up for installation.  i m really unhappy with this i m a frequent buyer from flipkart but this product has changed my thinking towards flipkart coz if u can't delight ur customer whats the use buying from here i called flipkart even chat almost 3 times i contacted flipkart guys no one turned up. when i called micromax they say there is no registraion of an installtion  i had a lost of Rs.1000/- as i did installation from an outsider he charged me RS.1000/-  now who will pay Rs.1000/- will flipkart pay huh very disappointing 	1 star	  26 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Nice beautiful and technically good LED in the price tag and flipkart has delivered it safe a day earlier than the scheduled delivery time --but I'm very sorry to say that after sales service from Micromax is extremely poor which will made me to think many times to purchase a Micromax LED. Now micromax saying it will not support 5.1 home theater & it will only support 2.1 audio system.What a pathetic TV !! so if possible i will rate -. 	1 star	  22 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  This is one of my worst experience in Getting order delivery. I would not rate best on TV, its really nice and one of the best Product. but i would like to give negative point to Flipkart service for their Customer service / Installation of Product / Communication about delay / Commitment which they made with their client.  It was really nightmare for me to get product at my house and installation done and experience with calling multiple time with Flipkart Support team.  About Product , its one of the best Product with really good Picture quality, i would recommended any one to buy this product but not from Flipkart with that poor customer communication/commitment level. 	1 star	  04 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  Highly dissatisfied. A pathetic service from Flipkart which I must agree was unexpected. This has cautioned me for future purchases online. 8 days past, and still I don't have my TV. Customer support/sales team keeps giving incorrect information on status and I never received a callback even after being promised thrice. UNACCEPTABLE .. And I am trying to be very polite in my choice of word.  Coming to product, item sent to me had NO AUDIO. Technician had no bloody idea. Tried software upgrade when it was evident it's a hardware issue. Finally was told that replacement will be provided. Since then, now 8 days and still unresolved, looks like they are reluctant on replacement of item even after being covered under Flipkart's 30 day replacement guarantee.   FLIPKART AND WS Retail SERVICE: UNACCEPTABLE and DISSAPOINTING. MICROMAX SERVICE: PATHETIC   	1 star	  15 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  I ordered this product on 3rd of May and received a call the very same evening from flipkart saying they would be delivering the product on 4th. The next day morning the product arrived in a spick and span condition with the proper delivery equipment. Now about the Television: Pros: #### 1. Amazing picture quality. I feel the picture quality is better than the Sony range of 32inches and equavelent to the samsung 32 inch quality. 2. The tv is light as a feather and extremely easy to install. I installed it myself on the stand and it is easy, steardy as well as allows you the flexibility to turn or ild the viewing position. 3. It has 2 USB ports compared to other TVs in it's segment which have just 1 and are much more expensive. Whats more that it plays all the formats expect for the FLV. 4. 2 HDMI ports allows for multiple products without having the hassle of using one or the other and the optical fibre audio output allows for connection to home theatres.  Cons: #### 1. The sound quality could have been a little better but it is perfectly fine to the normal TV viewer and in case you wish to really enhance the sound you can always connect speakers to the auxiliary port. 2. The remote could be a tad better responsive.  I would recommend this TV for anyone who wishes to enjoy HD quality LED viewing without having to spend like crazy on brands like Sony or Samsung. 	5 stars	  05 May 2014 
flipkart.com	  Yesterday i got this TV from flipkart .Thanks for flipkart such a great product delivering and giving less price compared to other market prices.   Pros: 1.Picture quality is very nice,i cant tell in words.. 2.i connected my 1 TB hard disk ,it supporting all formats like Mp4,MKV,mp3,AVi,divx etc. and displaying images JPEG,png,bmp, it will support to read .txt file also. 3.we can play music files. 4.looks very nice and really you wont get this price with any other companies like Samsung,lg,etc.even it has two usb ports and audio input,Samsung ,lg ,Sony they will give only one usb and no audio outputs. 5.coming to price lesser than other brands. and tv remote control features also very nice easily can operate. 6.sound also good and there is power audio option u can adjust more loud volume also.  CONS: no negative points in my point of view.  really worth buying of this product such a a price u wont get anywhere like this features with less cost.but people will think if it is foreign product means something will be there ,stop those thinking ,try to use Indian products.  i observed people are telling mkv format is not giving sound,because if audio is in dts format it wont play,upto now no led hd reay Tv except smart tv'swont support this format you have to convert to ac3 audio format ,then it will play... Any doubts you can ask me.  	5 stars	  12 Jun 2014

flipkart.com	  1. What I noticed is something others did not..I am amused why ? Lets talk about the look and feel..feels like cheap plastic..not the glam looks of a samsung and the Lgs that i own  2. Video performance at par with the 26inch LG i own .  3. An 7 on 10 for the audio while a 9 on 10 for the video crispness though poor skin tones, i will again settle for a 7 on 10.  4. Picked all video formats and loaded them super fast. a Big thumbs up there. Though some of the mkv movie files play without sound..awww grrr whyyy?  5. Un-natural skin tones ..the skin has unnatural yellows and greens .  5. Micromax take their own sweet time to come for a demo and installation that makes me a bit scared in case i need future support from them.  find a video review on YouTube by me ,search by my name and product name i.e Mohit Manuja + Micromax 32B200HD 32 inches LED TV 	3 stars	  27 Jun 2014

flipkart.com	  First,I am very happy for buying this product in Flipkart. This product had been delivered within 2 days. I was searching for a good economic LED TV for almost 2 months. Compare to all other vendors, I found low price in Flipkart with exchange offer.   Though Micromax delayed on installation due to long weekend, I could able to fix it by myself. Its very simple. All options in remote control are simple to understand.  Advantages: 1.Low Price with Exchange offer 2.Good clarity, Simple to install & use 3.Packing & Delivery 4.Able to play almost most of the video formats  Disadvantages: 1.As everyone say, sound is not good while using USB  If you are looking for a good, low price LED TV, This is the best product. According to me, investing more than 30K for same 32" branded LED TV is not a good idea.!!! 	4 stars	  30 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  I ordered this product on 16th June and 17th morning I got this delivered.But for installing it Micromax didn't even contacted me for 5 days.Honestly saying the customer satisfaction is very poor from Micromax side.When I contacted Micromax technician he just ingnored my complaint and he didn't even bothered about speaking me in a proper manner.So I just installed the product myself. So i will not refer you to buy this product because of the poor support from Micromax. 	2 stars	  23 Jun 2014

flipkart.com	  I was looking for a led TV for my parents in Kolkata as a gift as they themselves didn't want to spend to upgrade from their12 years old 29 inch samsung CRT. i am using a MMX A110 mobile for 2 years and it is working fine as of now, so took risk and ordered this TV. I only ensured it has a service center in Kolkata. I have ordered the same from Hyderabad. The TV was delivered within 2 days(ordered on Sunday night, delivered by Tuesday morning) and micromax mounted the same within 6 hours of delivery.   Pros : the backlit, colour and sharpness is awesome. i have recently gone home and checked myself. have two HDMI and 2 USBs(MY 2 year old LG LED have only one) also it is thin and light.perfect for my parents.though it is 720 P but it hardly matters for a 32 inch tv, that also with local cable !!!!  Cons : Sound is a bit letdown although enough for medium size room, it is not as much clear for the ear.The remote is very flimsy and even local Chinese dvd remote is better built. It can play almost all video formats although no sounds for high resolution .mpk files.The mounting clamp is not firm enough and that scares me. cannot comment on after sales services.  Verdict : If you can bear with the limitations ( High resolution MPK files, FLV files ) you can definitely buy this product,Best value for money product, recommended for aged people or as a 2nd TV. for better sounds you can use a 2.1 channel speaker or higher (i am using a 5.1, gives awesome sound). what more you can expect from a 16000 Rs LED TV (14000/- in exchange of a 15 year old BPL 21 inch in working condition)   Some words for Flipkart : Flipkart service has been exceptional as always and they are the best in terms of service,packaging and consumer satisfaction.before buying this TV tried calling the help line for the exchange offer. The customer care guy was very informative and easily made me understand the process which was also an easy one. flipkart not only schedules delivery date but also delivery time for high value products. And all this praise is coming from a person who even buys vegetables online. I use at least 5-6 online vendor , though Flipkart is a bit pricy at times, but hats off to their service. 	4 stars	  06 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  This product is simply awesome...far far ahead from Sony and Samsung with the same spec and at less than half the price.  Delivery : In less than 24 hours from Flipkart  Installation : I got a call for installation even before it was actually delivered. :) Display: Great ( Using Tata Sky HD) is good in SD too  Sound : This is the only place where it is lagging a bit, but looking at the amount you spent and using DTH it can be overlooked.  Looks: Great   Worth every single penny I have spent.   East or West India(n product) is best ;)   	4 stars	  04 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  Amazing product for this price. Micromax LED 32. I ordered this product two days before and got it on 24th May 2014. I installed it by myself (not mounted to wall), i mounted it on Table.It is very easy to install. And It video clarity is excellent and as well as sound also. I am planning to buy a woofer and add to it. I would recommend this Micromax LED for everyone. Don't miss this offer. Go on... 	5 stars	  25 May 2014

flipkart.com	  Update: Sound quality has deteriorated now with unwanted noise and low clarity. This exists both with and without external speakers. Sometimes noise is unbearable.  Old: I have been using this TV since 12th July of this month and found no problems with it. The sound quality problem reported by others is also not there, maybe their expectation was too high for the price they paid. Flipkart delivery was fast, Micromax installation took a bit more time. Also the mounting bracket could be a bit more sleek, because the TV projects a bit too much from the wall.  Flipkart had mentioned the product specification wrongly that this TV has wifi connectivity because of which I bought this TV :( ... But it turned out it was not there. Now they have corrected it after my complaint.  One thing I don't understand, there are two latest (2014) models available at lower price than this 2013 model - Micromax 32T42ECHD and Micromax 32T1111HD. They are sleeker and lightweight though have less number of ports. I believe you should buy those models instead of this. 	2 stars	  01 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  I bought this TV via Flipkart.  First of all it plays all the formats of movie files MKV, MP4 and AVI, thats the only reason i bought this TV.  Secondly, this TV has a subtitles facilities for the movie if you have got a file called *.srt for subtitles.  Thirdly, the sound and picture clarity is awesome, all hands down for Micromax for such a wonderful product. Forthly, dont buy any other brand, just blindly order this product and enjoy. Fifthly, I am completely satisfied with Micromax and Flipkart, well done...looking more products from Micromax...nice company though... 	5 stars	  26 May 2014 
flipkart.com	  A very great product at such a economical price, the display is just crystal clear and i am totally in love with it.

flipkart.com	  I have been using this tv from past two days, bought this as a replacement for my 24 led tv (Sony - EX430) since 24 inch tv is too small for my room, i got this for a price of rupees - 14,260/- from amazon.in  1) Look & Feel : ( 7/10 )  The build quality of this tv is not in par with other brands like sony, samsung and LG but still at this price its acceptable, the front panel design is good and USB and HDMI ports can be accessed easily. Tv also comes with a wall mount kit.  2) Connectivity : ( 10/10 )  It comes with 2 USB & 2 HDMI inputs, other top brands provides only one USB at the higher price, it plays all video formats with ease.   3) Video : (10/10)  The video and picture quality is in par with samung (32EH4003) and better than my previously used Sony EX-430 at this price we cant ask for any better, micromax has done a great job here  4) Audio : (6.5/10)  This is where micromax could have done better, the audio quality is not acceptable if you are using the tv in a large room, for small and medium sized room audio will not be an issue. This can be overcome buy using external speakers.  5) Pricing & VFM factor : (10/10)  This tv is available at the price between rupees 14300 to 16000 in different websites and at this price tag its a real value for money.  OVERALL RATING - [ 8.7/10 ] 	4 stars	  28 Jun 2014

When i contacted flipkart for the product replacement the scheduled the technician visit yesterday from 10AM to 2PM. i had waited all day long for tyhem to come but no one even showed up and ruined my whole day. when i called the customer care they said that their network is down and said that they will call me back. but till now no one showed up. very poor customer service and very much disappointed. better tear and throw your money in trash rather than buying this product. 	1 star	  26 Aug 2015

Each time i'm calling them they are telling a technician will visit my place within 24 hrs. they even issues me a complaint no. 150611-098012. I'm very much annoyed with the type of service/support.

As always, service from flipkart is awesome..!!! 	4 stars	  01 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Have never seen such a service by a company selling big electronics products like TV. I have been using the tv since 8-9 months the screen quality is okay other than that everything needs a improvement considering the price tag of this TV. The audio port stopped working and their service engineers doesn't even know what the port is for. They claim I am using it for a different purpose, when I have previously used a 3.5mm jack on that port. And after finally asking them to tell me a way to use the port I am ready to buy any cable and device to use it, they agreed and called their support team. Then they said that they will change the port within 2 weeks. And wow it is more than 45 days and no response or follow-up from Micromax. Just spend a bit more and go for LG, Samsung or similar brand. 	1 star	  25 May 2015

flipkart.com	  Firstly the TV is not bad, however my experience was.  The TV was not deliverable in my area, hence I had to wait in the rain for 4 hours for the TV to be delivered. The TV was supposed to be delivered between 11 AM- 1 PM. And I specifically told my purchase situation and requested to adhere to the timing, and was assured that it will be so.  I was waiting during this entire time period in the rain with the Cash wrapped in a plastic bag. The Delivery guy kept lying about the ETA. However I waited patiently and finally got the TV by then even my clothed were almost dry, I got it at 3:30 pm.  Grabbed a Cab and headed home. Installed the TV on the table top. Then tried to use the REMOTE to switch on the channel, found that the remote was not working. Just to be sure, I bought a double set of AAA batteries. Till then no use. Then called up the CS, they started reading some odd technical scripts. Which was no use.   After 1 hour of rubbish I was patched through to the SUPERVISOR who noted down the entire situation and arranged a technical visit.  24 hrs now, am still waiting for the installation guy to call me up and coordinate the location of installation.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of FLIPKART, even if products are cheaper in AM****N / SNA*****L / etc, I still choose FLIPKART over them for quality assurance. But after this experience I am having second thoughts.  Thank you reader for taking the time to read this. Hope it helps others. 	2 stars	  03 Sep 2014

flipkart.com	  I bought this for my parents who are senior citizens but i will not have gone for it for myself definitely. these are the reasons Cons: 1.The power cord is very cheap and very short 2. The quality of volume is not satisfactory but for them it is fine. 3. The volume is sufficient even very loud in AV mode while watching tv but very low while watching movies/videos through pendrive [you will definitely require external speakers for that]. 4. it is very hard to insert pen drive / hdmi etc as the sockets are behind the tv and there will be very less gap b/w the tv and wall after installation. 5. remote tells the story of cheapness. 6. Installation was late [not in 48 hours as i thought] 7. it can play every format but gets slow while playing full hd content. you cant watch full hd movie in slow motion. 8. it has the option to select the either of audio in dual audio videos/movies.[in info.]   PROS: 1. the display quality is at par with the leading brands. 2. there is significant risk of after sales service. you cant rely on these manufacturers for good after sales support even it takes days for the installation. 3. for my parents, it is satisfactory.  i got it in 14999 alongwith a football, got it in an offer otherwise didnt have gone for it for sure. 	4 stars	  10 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  I have been looking for tvs around 15-20k and most of them i found were around 24-26 inch ones among Sony, samsung and LG. I came to know of Micromax on flipkart, which had decent specs (32 inch TV) and reviews and decided to go for it. After a month of usage I can say it was a good decision.  Pros: Picture Quality:The display though of only 720p is very good. Colors are balanced and clarity retained. Flash Drive Compatability: It can play most of the formats from the external drive which is a good feature and its a treat to watch the HD movies on this 32 inch screen. Value for Money: You get a 32 inch TV with all the important features at 16K which in other brands would mean to shell out more money. Flipkart Delivery: As usual, service from flipkart was good. I got a call within one day of ordering for delivery and was installed the day after.  Cons: Sound Quality: Sound quality is bit wayward. Also the balance is bad across channels which may be a settop box problem. You do wish for more powerful speakers at times but at this price its hard to complain.  Overall, if anyone is looking for a non-smart TV with decent features (like playback HDMI..) and a large screen, this would be a good bet.  	4 stars	  04 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  I got the TV delivered on Sunday and till now no one has turned up to do the installation. The micromax instruction booklet so cheaply printed that the figures are not clear....I ended up putting a wrong screw to the pathetic "10-15 screw table mount stand....now it does not come out and I m helplessly waiting for someone to help. The flipkartt number goes dead after the inputs I make and 3-4 calls went dead with no response so I gave up. Tuesday night at 9 PM some one called me from flipkart and says that it is not yet 48 hours! I think these guys should order a new watch from flipkart! It's still not 48 hours!!!!   Never expected such pathetic service from such a company! Also the cheap micromax stand has worsened my worried wait 	1 star	  24 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  Great buy considering the cost.   Picture clarity is amazing and installation was seamless. Design incorporates some nice modes like auto off and two USB ports. .  Since the product is new to the market I will have wait to see long term reliability.   Since the investment is low it should't really matter either way. 	4 stars	  22 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  Well, 1st thing 1st.. the delivery happened within 20hrs of making the payment that too Free in Delhi. The packaging was sealed. So no issues there either. However, the Fkart delivery guy asked me not to open the packaging myself. He asked me to wait for the Micromax installation team.guy to arrive at my place and let them only open the packaging. So in essence there was no way for me to check the LED set inside the packaging when the delivery happened.. Wierd! (The delivery guy gave the reason - "Sir kahin aap se damage ho gya open karte time, to iski warranty bhi bekaar ho jayegi")  The Micromax guy called the very next morning to install the set.  The product itself is as promised. Its a HD ready (so no 1080p). so it supports upto 720p. However, to the naked eye the difference between a 1080p n 720p may not be too much..(at least I compared it to the other MMax LED I have - Full HD 39" both beaming TataSky HD channels) Btw I tired my PS3 with 1080p resolution, the TV could handle it while displaying the PS3 game menu, but as soon as I tried launching a game, the TV switched back to 720p.. but again the output was equally good as on my other Full HD MMax LED)  The LED had zero dead pixels.   The sound quality is good. In fact the room where I installed the set is quite small (22x10ft), so unfortunately I'm unable to test the volume beyond 5-6 (it goes upto 100!).  Overall quite a VFM LED. 	3 stars	  17 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  delivery i would rate it 9.5/10   decent features ,dont expect this led screen to be sharp as as other high end brand like samsung or lg , but this one is nice decent quality for price you are paying. 	4 stars	  13 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  It's working simply perfect. Good Viewing and worth for the money. Good HD quality picture and simple operations. Weight less and easy to wall mount. 	5 stars	  13 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  It has everything one would expect from a modern LED TV, all packed in a very reasonable price. I have it hooked up with an HD set top box, and also use it for playing games via HDMI link to my PC and watching movies & shows off my USB drive.  The only downside is that the speakers buzz a bit on loud volumes. But again I do not often play it loud. I wouldn't complain too much about the picture quality as it's perfect for the price tag (maybe better?). 	4 stars	  12 Jun 2014

flipkart.com	  I have used this for 2 months. Till now, No complaints. I would say, Audio is not upto the mark however the price tag and video output makes me to compromise with the audio output.  Build quality is poor that justifies the price tag. Image quality is good, so far I have mainly used for PS3.   Delivery was intact and quick by flipkart. Tv installation was within hours after the delivery. 	5 stars	  23 Sep 2015 
flipkart.com	  Using the product for past two weeks.. Good in all aspects.. Good sound clarity, especially when connected to USB.. Picture quality is of real HD. Thin and compact. I have placed it on the table rather than wall mounting.  Overall, Its worth for the price. Thanks for Micromax and Flipkart.. Service from WS retail is superb, I should say.. Excellent packing and delivery on scheduled time with installation in two days time. We no need to bother about anything.. I suggest those who wish to buy their first TV, just go for it... 	5 stars	  22 Sep 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this about a couple of months ago, here is my review TV overall is OK... performs good for a lower end price section.

flipkart.com	  Received the delivery on 8th sep 2015(Tuesday), ans was told by the delivery guy that they have registered the TV with Micromax , and that they will come by Thursday and the wall mounted fitting would be done. It is now sunday and no news. I had to call Micromax cust care and initiate a SR for the fitting to be completed .  Fail to understand why these people make false claims and create a sour taste for the customer in the end.Why cant they be truthful and ask us to contact the given company cust care number or better carry a list of all the companies cust care number with them and give it to the customer.  Flipkart does not have a Cust care number to air the grievances.If one day they decide to shut their services , then god bless customers. Really pained and disappointed with the pathetic attitude displayed towards paying customers.  	1 star	  13 Sep 2015

flipkart.com	  I have ordered a TV from Flipkart and received on the said date (Saturday). Was satisfied by the delivery but installation uhhhh..... worst like anything. Installation ppl called me on sat morn, b4 I receive the product and said will do it by tat day end. Later, wen i received the product, I called back for installation. The one who spoke gave me various nos to dial for confirming installation. Finally, no response and got a reply from the last call tat all the technicians were busy so they ll come on monday. Frustrated with this I called flipkart customer care and micromax,both responded negative. Its really really disgusting experience with flipkart. Den,after 3 days, after our continuous calls, flipkart has sent a technician.  Flipkart is seeking just for a sale of a product no customer satisfaction. No response from micromax too. When called micromax, they are asking to deal installation process with flipkart. I would really rate "0" for flipkart customer service and satisfaction. But for the delivery am giving one. 	1 star	  03 Sep 2015

My order was sent through a very bad courier service named Gati prepaid couriers. Courier guys didnt deliver the product to the designated address, instead they were asking us to come and collect from the office.  I request Flipkart to not to make use of such courier services. 	2 stars	  23 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  I was a little hesitant ordering the TV given the price but I find it good enough for a budget room TV or 2nd TV. The sound is not very loud but good enough for a normal bedroom say 100~125 sq foot  The picture quality is good and has simple features.  I am using it as a monitor cum room TV and I think the display is cutomized to far vieing, nonetheless it is very good for the price.  There were some small issues with installation delay by 2 days but I have been using it since 2 weeks almost after that and all is well. 	4 stars	  20 Aug 2015

flipkart.com	  Hi Guys,  I am really love to give review about this TV. i got the TV before 1 week for Rs.1350 with CITI bank credit card , i have already bought an Philips 32 inch tv(philips32pfl3938) through flipkart it also deliverd quick and installation done on the same day, when compare with philips really this Micromax 32b200hdi was awesome.   Advantages: - great metal stand with nice weight to balance the TV - Installation is done within 2 hours after the product got delivered( awesome) & they have done both wall mounting stand and the tv stand too. -picture quality is great same as the philips..... -sound quality is better than philips.  Disadvantage: - sound is poor when using USB  really this TV is great for the people who thinking to buy a new LED TV at the range of 32 inches.   	5 stars	  19 Aug 2015

flipkart.com	  I am writing this review-after using this TV nearly 2 and half months  It is suitable only for cable TV users-Quality is good I didnt check with Dish TV connection yet It can play the different movie format which was said in internet.  But you guys must check its (HD Ready, 1366 x 768) resolution spec because, When I am playing Hollywood movies with 1920x720 resolution in this TV, its start to flicker. Even I checked with lesser than 500 resolution but It is flickering. But I accept that this resolution is higher than what they said in spec. I should have checked all the video format and resolution within the 30 days of return period-if I did like that, I could have found this problem earlier and I could have returned back To find out the reason, I have sent a mail regarding this issue to micromax on 8th July, but there is no response from their side even after 3 of remainder mails from my side. After that, I escalated this to flipkart customer care. After some days got a call from flipkart and they gave 2 no.s of micromax customer care. I contacted the given no.s and booked an appointment for service checking. Micromax person came and saw the flickering (On 07/08/2015) and told that he will come with suitable video format with micromax specified resolution on Monday (10.08.2015)  Those who want to see movies with higher resolution like 780 or 1080-Please don't go with this product. Before buying I red all the customer reviews and there was no such video flickering complaint, so straight away i bought this TV.  I am writing this review for upcoming new buyers to make aware of this problem  Flipkart delivery was good and supported me to get micromax customer care no. in my circle.  Dear Friends, I request you all to check your TV and let me know the feedback. So that i can claim Micromax to replace the total unit or faulty parts.  Thanks Rajkumar.K 	2 stars	  08 Aug 2015

flipkart.com	  This LED TV is really has very good picture quality,,, The TV was delivered as per scheduled by Flipkart and installation was done within further 2 days,,, I have done lots of research before buying LED TV,,,,I have zeroised on this Micromax 32B2000HDi,,,,It is really Good Product to buy for a budget of around 15K,,,The biggest plus of the TV is its Picture quality for a merge price of 15K,,,,The Sound quality is bit low but with few adjustment you can make it decent. There is also option of external speakers which you can connect. I am using Tata Sky HD Set Top Box which further enhances the viewing experience to a Great deal,,,,I have also watched some Videos through USB and found the quality OK...The TV comes with Two HDMI Ports which is good,,,,  I think before opting for high end brands Like LG, Samsung, Sony one should compare the picture quality & Price & Features of this Product with high end brands,,, I am Sure you wont find any difference in Picture quality except Price  Just Go for it guys,,,,This is nice Product.... 	4 stars	  23 Jul 2015

But my luck was good and got this TV in flipkart sale and got 1500rs discount also. :) Thanks flipkart   One again thanks and Hats off for your prompt delivery. Received the product in 4 days. Also got the call for Flipkart customer care same day regarding request raised for the installation of TV.  Kudos to you flipkart!!!!  Now lets review the TV.  Pros: 1) I was amazed to see the picture quality. Seriously i was not expecting this kind of quality.  2) 2 HDMI. 1 for TataSky and 1 for my PS3. Wow 3) USB interface. Most formats are playing like fluid. Except a few videos were playing audio-less video. Also GUI interface of USB could have been better. 4) VFM truly.  Cons: 1) Sound is not very loud. The speaker is back facing so sound is not coming to front effectively. However a decent external speaker will overcome this issue. 2) Subtitle: TV is supporting the subtitles srt files but the subtitle is appearing small and are white in color. There is no way to change this setting. May be a firmware update fix this issue. Requesting MMX to do this.  3) USB user interface could have been better.  Overall great value for money... you can't ask get any more than this in this price.. 	4 stars	  09 Jul 2015

I raised a complain on 25th of march(Complain number MMr29041529227).A person came to visitand he told me that it will take around 15 days, but he came after 20 days and was not able to repair. After that on 27 may he raised a new complain no hp270515374714 and I got a information that your problem will be short out by 6 of june but nothing happen.  Now I am sick of it and need it , Very poor service I thing they should be baned like Maggi   	1 star	  15 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Really I appreciate many of Micromax products, but I strongly disagree with this product,   1.Audio of this TV is not at all a worth one, we cant hear the sound even if we sit near to the TV. 2.Even I tried to connect my external speaker, but display goes in vain... It loses its picture quality.  Now I have raised return request of this product, I will choose better one than this. Hope flipkart will help me in this to get me a beautiful product.  	1 star	  15 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Got the product and shocked to see remote was missing and Glass stand had a small crack on it but its OK. I bought it for watching movies and which needs good quality of sound and it is lacking and one more drawback u can only connect Speakers 2.1 and not the 5.1 home theater. One more thing I was guided that one internet button will be there on remote so that u can access the internet but I checked with my friend's remote it is not there on the remote. HD quality is also not that Good, but the good part is there is no glare means view angle is good and can see in any direction, picture will be clear.  LAST COMMENT : Disappointed with quality but ok with Price.. People with low budget can go for this product. 	3 stars	  12 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Rating  Display : 5 Star  - Direct LED is very good. - Can be set into lower power consumption mode. - Side angle view is also not so much dark.  Sound: 3 Star - There are two option. Power Audio & Normal Audio. But it is creating very minor difference. - Sound is very slow on some channels and in some movies using inbuilt speaker.  I think it is recommended to buy home theater system. 	4 stars	  10 Jun 2015

flipkart.com	  Definitely not worth the price or the ratings given here. Its a cheap TV with very bad picture quality. Buying this TV was a disaster. On the very first day when we setup the TV the picture quality was very bad. It looks pixelated with a reddish shade on each frame. We thought it was some setup issue and waited for the installation person to come. After two weeks of struggling to change the installation address some technician visited and said it is supposed to be like that only, there is no fault. He adjusted some colors and we showed his the difference with existing TV but he still acted like there is no problem. We again called up Micromax and they said your video quality is poor. We were playing a 1080p video! We asked them to get a video from their side which they think is the best and play it on the TV but on the next visit also they tried to convince us it is supposed to be that way.  It is not only a horrible TV but horrible service and policies by Flipkart that the vendor will confirm if the TV is damaged. Ofcourse the vendor is never going to say yes! So now we are stuck with a pathetic picture quality TV 	1 star	  22 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  So many consumer have faced this problem of installation. Micromax do not take pain to install TV purchased on line.

flipkart.com	  I really didnt wanna spend too much money on a TV and tried my luck on this one so that I can use it both as a TV and a Monitor!!!!! The TV is as good as its big brother the 40 Inch TV.. Just doesn what it says!!!!! The Installation service was fantastic... Came in the same day for installation and as always the Flipkart Service is superb!!!!!   Go for it if you want a TV and Monitor !!!!!!! If you are looking at crystal sharp pictures, dont go for thiss one as this is HD Ready. I knew it before buying it !!!!! 	5 stars	  21 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  This is a very good TV within a good price tag. Flipkart went upto my highest expectations as delivered within 36 hours of ordering it. The installation tech also reached well before time for installation. The performance is very good only slight problem is the sound quality which should have been better. But any way it is worth comparing its price. The sound deficiency can be resolved by using a 2.1 computer speakers with which the quality of sound improved a lot. Thanks flipkart for the amazing service till now. 	4 stars	  20 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  TV stopped working in a week. Flipkart's only response is please wait for 2 days for any update. while buying i was informed that product will be replaced if any issue happens in 30 days. But when mine stopped working in a week there is neither a replacement nor repair. There was a guy who came and checked what happed to TV from Micromax. He concluded board has to be changed and vanished.  So conclusion, i made a mistake ordering product from Flipkart. Disappointing service. 	1 star	  15 May 2015

flipkart.com	  ==>I have purchased this Micromax 32B200HDi LED tv, & i m using is for 1 week.   ==>I m giving 5 star to Flipkart for its service. But will give 3.5 star to Micromax.   ==>There is no toll free customer care no. in micromax, & also no response in tolled no.  ==>Now come to the point for tv.   ==>Picture quality is very good but still not upto the mark, as skin tone is not good (not natural).   ==>Sound quality is very bad, though it has 10 W + 10 W speakers, but its sound is not up to the 6W + 6W speakers of other brand tv (which is in similar price range). It is worst when we play through usb.  ==>Also not supporting the movie which is in mkv format. How ever we can see the video but audio is not supportable.   ==>So micromax have to update the software in this tv, as mkv format is also supporting in other brand tv (which is in similar price range). with clear sound in just only 6W + 6W speakers. (As flip kart is not giving permission to give the name of that brand, however the tv from that brand are also selling from flipkart.)   ==> It is good that, It has 2-hdmi, 1-usb, 1-vga ports, 1-headphone jack, 2 port for extra speakers (L & R).   ==>We can directly attach the extra speakers of 2.1 channel without woofer. & with the help of extra speakers, its rocking.   ==>I am very disappointing with the review given by a person,  who has written that it has 2 usb port but in this tv has only 1.   ==>Sound is not good from the tv speakers as he has described .   ==>I also want to contact to him for, how to play movie by usb, which is in mkv format? As he has written that he can play the movie using usb drive which is in mkv format or he can convert from mkv to ac3.   ==>Also, how can i convert from mkv to any other format?   ==>Can we install VLC player in our tv????   Plz reply me.   If anyone have any solution for this problem, then plz reply me with the help of this review portion.

We had no inputs available for checking the inputs to TV hence only checked USB at time of demo. Demo was on time.   Product quality : 6/10 # (-2) There are two white spots just near to speakers at bottom both side edges of screen, fairly visible when screen is black. Just like a CRT TV getting screen RED when near to external magnetic field. Not resolved and seems this is for life time of product.  # (-1) Can see screen flickering for first few days then got used to and have no problem, I think refresh rate of the screen is not so good.  # (-1) According to me the product quality differ from other brands as like price ..! 	1 star	  05 May 2015

flipkart.com	  First of all Hats off to flipkart for Lightning delivery of the product... placed d order on saturday afternoon... arrange d schedule to monday evening between 6 to 9 and guess what product was at the door at monday evening 6.15pm.... sp thumbs up for that...  Now about the TV... Display quality best in this price range... Look and Design .. Thats the best among all the features of this LED Easy interface to jump from your av mode to dvd or usb plug n play ... 2 AV ports that you can attach your STB and DVD player simultaneously 1 more USB port would have been better but one 2.0 USB is enough 2 HDMI ports for HD ready (its not a full HD LED.. You can play 720p movies or videos)  Cons : Sound quality is so poor... It would have been better remote control is not that responsive...  All in all it is the best buy till now... Value for money it u hav got a good home theater system... ;)  **I've used this LED more than a week now.. !!! 	4 stars	  13 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  First of all thanks to flipkart for matching the scheduled delivery .  The product is great and thumbs up to micromax for the excellent quality of the product. Easy switch between the various inputs TV , AV1, VGA and USB.  In USB mode all the video formats are played. FLV, MPG, DAT, 3GGP, 3GP , MOV etc. In all a great product and with the offers I was able to get it at almost 55 % of the MRP. 	5 stars	  08 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Not the best product but good for the price at which i got from Flipkart. Micromax person is little sluggish but i feel its a good deal in the end.  	5 stars	  06 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  First of All, Thanks to Flipkart for the AMAZINGLY FAST DELIVERY!! It was within 24 hours including the engineer visit for the Wall Mount.  Secondly, this TV is not less than the other branded products which are available in the market with a huge price tag, although the sound is a little bit low, but still you can compromise on that as you can connect speakers...  Lets hope for the best and I have a feeling that this will serve me long! 	4 stars	  05 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this TV intrigued by the low price. But in 2 days of use, I found that this TV has lots of issues.  1. First of all, there are quality issues with the table top stand. Though it doesn't affect the TV viewing, it shows very poor quality controls.   2. Very annoying backlight bleed. This TV suffers from a very annoying back light bleed around the corners and edges. This is very disturbing when you watch darker scenes.  3.The sound from analog outs (headphone / AV out has annoying "static" noise). The volume control and audio quality is pretty bad. The volume suddenly increases when you move from 0 to 5 and then its stops increasing from 15 onwards. The volume scale is 0-100. So there isn't much of a "volume control". None of these issues exist if you plan to use a separate HT audio system.  Overall a pretty poor quality TV and I would recommend people to NOT to get intrigued by its low price. There are severe quality issues associated with this set. 	1 star	  01 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  After using a small tv for 9 years i wanted to buy a LED tv. I opted to buy it from Flipkart. I believed them and bought Micromax 32" LED TV. I got delivery on time and installed the same day. When watching a tv, i saw a white patch on both the side of the screen. I am upset that flipkart has delivered me a rejected piece. I dont know whether this TV has a quality problem. I believed you flipkart, its your duty to send me a good quality TV. If micromax is not the best brand then you should not market it. I had doubts when ordered for Micromax, but believed that flipkart will not market bad brands and opted for it. I made a mistake. Its hurting for a middle class person to buy a TV believing somebody and they cheat you. 	1 star	  21 Mar 2015

flipkart.com	  Display: beautiful (is absolutely clear on my tata sky HD and PS3, to a normal vision eye, I havent tried a magnifying glass to check for pixels).   Size: Very Slim (sits perfectly on my tv table). The 32" is good enough for a medium sized family lounge.   Pretty sturdy base.  2 HDMi ports work like a charm.   USB: its exceptional, has played almost 99.99% of the video files i have. And i have some very recent and old movies. No issue here. The interface is also very user friendly.   Cons: Sound. It actually sucks. You should get an inexpensive 2.1 with this tv, it would work wonders then.   Love this TV for the price they are selling it.  Would recommend it to anyone. 	5 stars	  10 Mar 2015

flipkart.com	  I have requested for a replacement on this product because I was not satisfied with the LED lights flashing up on the screen, as in I could see the lights on both sides of the panel, especially when on black screen or in white screen, I could see a little bit of yellowish lights. however, even after the replacement, I still can see the same thing on the new TV as well. so I doubt if this is a normal thing with the TV or the model. I cant say if this will last in the long run. 	2 stars	  07 Mar 2015

flipkart.com	  Picture quality is not that much good in compare to other standard brands as sony or LG. Sound quality is too poor in this LED.

flipkart.com	  The tv looks value for money but nonetheless, it has some draw backs. The sound quality is not good. One might need external speakers. The menu pop ups looks faby'.

All other standard features are available as in S & L brands. 	4 stars	  21 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  TV just came a day on the preferred day.. but the installation local team made a complete mess.. after 15 to 20 calls and repeated remainder they came.. For the price TV will blow you... Superb quality.. for flipkart four stars 	4 stars	  18 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  First impression on swithing on the TV - Suberb. Thanks to Flipkart for a faster and safer delivery and a quick installation. Many of my known advised me not to by a TV of Micromax brand. But after using it for 2 Days I can say that they should reconsider their advise. The picture quality is as good as other Brands like LG, Samsung or Sony etc. Sound is also decent. Just the quality of sound could have more clear, but is more than OK at this price range. I have attached my PC and 2.1 speakers with it and are working good. Overall a nice product. I recommend this TV to all who are looking to buy a similar kind of TV with lower price. Exceeds my expactations. Nice work done Micormax. 	5 stars	  12 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  The picture quality is very good, The product got delivered to me in just 2 days and the very next day the micro max service man came to install the product. The Sound is going to be a issue for all those who are used to listen to tv at a higher volume(like i do). You would definitely need Home Theater speakers to enhance sound quality! I bought F & D Speakers and after that the experience is quite great. But i must admit the product looks very beautiful 	3 stars	  11 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  About TV:-  Voice Quality only problem, In case of USB its very low but u can connect speakers Itll be superb. When u comes to Cable tv or Tata Sky Volume Is Very Good enough. U can connect ur Laptop by using HDMI cable.  About Flipkart:-  Ordered On 21st Nov'14, Delivered on 23rd and installed On 25th Nov... Took only 4 days thanks to flipkart.  	5 stars	  11 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  Bought this product from Flipkart. The delivery happened in the 2 days. Got delivered on a Sunday. The installation call from Micromax was right on time and in the next 2 days, the TV was installed and running. I recommend to buy it from Flipkart. 	5 stars	  11 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this TV at Flipkart. The delivery was great. Use the TV for a couple of months now. The display was good but the sound is poor. We need to keep it in 50 for a normal volume. But comparing the price range it was ok. We were not able to integrate my Sony home theatre DVD player for sound in this TV, which we were doing in my old LG Tv....ie. the normal TV sound can be heard through the DVD player. 	4 stars	  11 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this product on December 8 ,2014 which delivered to my friend in Mysore as i am staying in Coorg. But i forget to enter installation address . I updated it on December 12 . I was much disappointed with FK s service . They dont have co ordination with each other departments. I called 5 times for installation ,Each time the executives promises installation will be done with in 24 to 48 hours . . Finally they done installation only on 10 december ,2015. I am happy with performance of product , I recommend everyone to buy as it is great Indian product at very affordable price . Dont look further if u r budget is around 15 k. 	5 stars	  11 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this under exchange against my 29inch crt tv which was working perfectly! Now I cannot get my old tv back also I am at the mercy of flipkart to provide me with replacement(which I don't know if it will have same low volume problem) FK cust support is good but this product's volume is so low that it can be heard at full volume ( 100 points) if you are sitting next to TV. Its volume at 100% is unsuitable for even a small room; don't even consider buying it for a bigger room. Buyer Beware ! If you plan for an exchange to buy this TV and for some reason are not satisfied with new TV, you will get only money back but YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR OLD TV BACK so in the end you will be without a TV. Choose wisely and stay away from this product. I am repenting because I bought this. 	1 star	  10 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  Received TV with Audio issue.  After struggling so much and calling Flipkart customer care n number of times got the replaced one.   Even after keeping volume to 100 in both volume and power audio till clarity of voice is not good.   Installation will not be done until call customer care.  Cost wise good product.   But service/replacement is not good from flipkart.   	3 stars	  06 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  I purchased this product 8 months back... Good picture quality,  Value for money.. Initially one needs to adjust contrast & sharpness 	5 stars	  29 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  I purchased 32b200hd from amazon during 15th august watched that for 2 months and gave it to my sister.It was having  1) 2 USB,  2 ) location of USB port was a way near to the edge so that it was easy to plug in.  All these important things are not present in 32b200hdi.  The display quality is good.  First I thought the sound qulity is very poor however Stop the surround sound feature & increase the volume level using volume button on remote. It is pretty good. default volume is around 30 and increasing it to 50 is enough.  Someone mentioned that the tv doesnot have buttons and user needs to do all actions using remote. it's wrong. at the back side of tv there are few buttons.  Flipkart was very good and delivered tv quickly, gave 2000 Rs off for exchange, the installation guys came on the same day and fit the tv.  A good product as a second TV. if you are having budget constraint then good as first tv as well :)  I am watching it on SD connection and quality is OK. Not tried on HD box. 	4 stars	  29 Dec 2014

When micromax launched the TV in Flipkart there is no delivery option for my pincode. Finally they provided the option...  The delivery was on time by Flipkart.  The service engineer came next day to install the TV. product is OK to go... Sound quality not that much good.. 	4 stars	  17 Dec 2014

flipkart.com	  Got this TV as a replacement for my old Sony CRT. Flipkart gave an exchange of 2K, which was really great. I already have a Samsung 40' and this was for the bedroom.   Observations - 1. A/V - 5/8 - Overall experience - Satisfying 2 Dont like the beige color at the bottom of the panel. All black would have been so much better 3 Ports on the LHS. Would have been great if the ports were on the RHS 4. Remote quality could have been better 	4 stars	  28 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  NEVER BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS WEBSITE AS THEY SELL DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS. THE SOUND IS NOT AT ALL UPTO THE MARK AND THIS IS THE REASON FOR DISCOUNT. I WISH I COULD RATE THIS PRODUCT IN NEGATIVE. 	1 star	  23 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  The product, is decent. You get what you pay for. An above average LED which can also connect 2 HDMI and play all famous video format's via USB.  Flipkart 1) Great job with delivery. Did as committed. 2) Poor on the post delivery installation, I got my call from the engineer on the 4th day, that was despite my repeated reminders each day. I ended up installing the TV through a local technician and FK was courteous enough to credit the charges. However, the customer service team has for sure gone downward in the last year. I remember a year back when i ordered and called FK CC for a request to see if they can deliver the product a day before, the CCR would take interest and I would feel that they were actually feeling accountable and they never let me down. Today, you call and you get a scripted response, 24 to 48 hr tat spiel. Not impressed, seems the the Elephant has indeed fallen after all. Good short run. R.I.P. 	3 stars	  15 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  About The Product :-  Big Fat Texla ( Old Working CRTV for 2000/-) & Got This For 13740/- (LED 720P WOWW!!)  Pros  All The Movie Formats(flv,avi,mpg etc) & Subtitles(.srt) Working..Jpgs + Mp3 + Text. 1 x USB & 2 X HDMI & A VGA Port & Vga Port Not To Be Found In Any Other Brands & 2 RGB Ports (2 AV'S) Video Clarity & 1 Tb Hard Disk Also Compatible Which Was Not Recognized In Panasonic & Onida & Toshiba Lower Than 22k Range Leds & Interface Wasnt Good Also..In This Price Its Superb Deal.  Cons:-  1.Voice Quality..In Case Of USB Its Very Low But You Can Buy Some Cheap Speakers It Will B Superb As It Has An Aux Point With It & When It Comes To Cable Tv (Spectranet/Airtel/Tata Sky) Volume Is Good Enough It Works On 50% Of Volume As All These Setup Boxes Have Their Own Volume Control.  2. 1 x USB Port. 3. Remote Is Not That Responsive.  About Flipkart:-  Ordered On 9th Nov, Delivered On 15th Nov & Was Expected On 13th So Overall Service Was Bit Delayed But Alast Several Follow Up & 5 To 6 Calls Backend People Were Helpful.. 	5 stars	  15 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  I have received the TV on 07 Nov and till 13 Nov for commissioning no one had come. The TV i have received was a defective once and when i called to the customer care they told technician will come and see within 48 hrs then only they can replace the product.No one came and i called back after two days they told me to wait for one more 48 hrs.  When i made the return request through online te next day it got automatically updated as problem resolved.This is the system they have.with all poor communication.   This is the kind of service they could provide.  Finally i am still holding the defective piece waiting for the service engg to come. 	1 star	  15 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  If you can live with a blarring speaker then only go for it. Alternatively invest in some good external speakers. Display is good at this price. As usual delivery of Flipkart was up to the mark. The product which was delivered to me ha a sound issue. It took nearly 1 month struggling with Flipkart to have a replacement. I'm scared now of buying any other product from Flipkart as their replacement policy is fishy. If the brand confirms the product is defective then only they will replace. In my case Micromax team was not ready to confirm the product has a issue. The CS took me on concall and the engineer admitted there was 30-50% defect in the product. How did he evaluate that!!! Its better to spend some extra money and go for Philips, LG or Samsung. 	2 stars	  17 Sep 2014

flipkart.com	  1st things 1st... Flipkart was amazingly quick with the delivery. Got in on the next day i placed the order at the specific mentioned time. Kudos to that.  The Micromax engineer came the day after to set it up (Hardly needed any set up... very easy for any one with basic know how)  The TV itself... is great value for money. 2 USB + 2 HDMI Ports. Crisp picture. User friendly.  The only worry i had when i read all the reviews was the sound quality. I still went ahead as i thought you'd have to compromise somewhere for the cost. But the sound problem that I now have in hand (which I'm not too displeased with) is to how loud this TV is. I dont quite know what the ppl meant when they wrote about sound probs. This is a beast.  I'd recommend everyone to go for this. Complete Value for money. With the 1 YR warranty. 	5 stars	  02 Sep 2014 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart delivered TV on 17th August. But failed to arrange for installation team . its been more than 15 days installation, not yet done...

flipkart.com	  This is a gr8 TV at this price. Don't think u r buying anything cheap so output would be cheap. It is not so. This TV is quality stuff. Except the sound, but that is the case with all LED TVs. Look at the price of other TVs offered for 32". Unfortunately, u will not find any one near this price. They are all atleast 5K higher. So, moral of the story is that "if you don't want to spend much and still want to enjoy the benefits of LED TV, this product is for you". U won't regret it. Fortunately, I bought it in the Deal of the Day-Price-15K. Isn't it Wow. The delivery, installation, etc was also gr8. Thank you Flipkart. Caution: Pl don't compare it with other high end TVs above 40K range. If you are too quality conscious and your budget is not restricted, then you may ignore this TV. 	5 stars	  23 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Hi All,  I did not knew that the Flip Cart service is So worst or else I would have never opted for it. I ordered this TV on 11thAugust 2014. Now check what happens: 1. The TV gets delivered on 12th August 2014. 2. The Technician can for installation on 16th August 2014 (i.e. for 4 days the TV was just kept in the box ) 3. On the day Technician came, it was noticed that the TV is defective. Technician tells me to contact filpkart to get replacement. 4. I call them and tell them the whole scenario but even when their Technician has already told that there is a fault, they want another Technician to check the TV. I accept that. 5. The Technician comes on 21st Aug and told that there is fault but he has to open and check the TV (Remember that the TV is yet not used). I told him that you want to open the TV itself means that there is some issue in the TV. But he still doesnt accepts. 6. He opens and tells there is fault in the PCB, writes something on a paper and leaves saying please call your dealer i.e. FLIPKART. 7. I am calling Flipkart from that day and they keep saying we will forward your call , Our executive will call you by day end, We can transfer your money if you dont want the product but it will take 12 working days , We can transfer your money into your flipkart account but this will take 4-5 days. 8. Finally today they messaged me We have escalated your issue to the concerned team. We will resolve your problem by 2nd Sept, 7:00 PM  Guys please help me what should I do in this case. From 11th August to 2nd September..   One more thing came up here, I have to compulsory rate the product atleast 1 start as without that the review wont be submitted. 	1 star	  23 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  I am very happy with this product given its price. Display is good, unlike other reviews I am happy with sound as well, that may be because of my hall accoustics. 2 HDMI ports are handy.  Delivery and installation was on time. But as is the case with Micromax mobiles, the real test is after a year or two of usage.  Only thing I am unhappy about is price fluctuation on Flipkart. I ended up paying 1000 more. 	4 stars	  22 Aug 2014

flipkart.com	  I purchased this TV Micromax 32B200HD this month only. The service guy came two setup after this was delivered. This deliver and setup could have been planned simultaneously.

flipkart.com	  I bought this TV from flipkart last week, first i want to thank Flipkart for the excellent delivery, too good service, packing is excellent. This TV is an excellent, we won't get a TV in the market with these features for this price, the sound is awesome and the picture is also good, if you use a HD connection then it looks awesome.Compared to other high branded tv's, this one is little thicker in size, there is no much difference only a little, but the appearance is very good and also the remote is very sylish.I think this product is 100% worth for the money we spend.  Those who don't want to spend too much money for buying a TV, you can go for this, absolutely no doubt, it's a good product.  	4 stars	  19 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Awesome product !!!  It is an budget TV which satisfies all your needs !!! Highly recommended.  Make sure you have an HD connection to have a good quality watching. 	5 stars	  19 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Delivery from flipkart was pretty good and I got the TV second day of ordering. Service from Micromax isn't the best, they called me after 4 days of delivery for installation which is quiet late and I had got the TV installed by then. I would like to mention a few downside which a user must know before buying. This model has 2 HDMI ports and 2 USB which makes it the best buy and the only TV in the range of 15000-25000. What I didn't like about the model is that both the HDMI and 1 USB is given in the rear and if you mouting it on wall it becomes inaccessible. To add to my woes both the HDMI are place hardly with a gap of 0.5 cm, so you can hardly use both the ports at one go.  To solve my problem I need to buy an HDMI extension and if I was aware of the problem I would have preferred buying Micromax 32T42ECHD instead of this model. 	3 stars	  18 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Hi,  I received the product very next day of booking it. Later, I was in a dilemma, whether I should call micromax customer care for installing it or not ???? But for my surprise, within 3 hrs of delivery, I got a call saying that the service person will come and will get the TV installed THAT TOO ON A SUNDAY :) .. He installed the TV and explained about different features of the same.. This is in BANGALORE. Not sure about other places.   Reviews about TV - Its an awesome product at that price. Sound is bit low and not clear. Micromax has to work on that. Rest all - just amazing It can play almost all movie formats. 	4 stars	  18 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Satisfied but the shipping for this product is limited.it'll be better to extend the shipping to other regions. 	4 stars	  18 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  The stars are for FLIPKART more than the TV. The TV itself is value for money. Two issues are 1) The volume is limited and once wall mounted its difficult to reach most of the ports. Use and extender and external powered speakers and you shud be fine. Coming back to FLIPKART, 5 stars on several service counts. The replacement was as lightning fast as the initial delivery. A word on ther training, getting uniform service level execution across different staff members is something they have got right. THE IS A UBUFORMITY OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF COURTEOUS SERVICE FROM 4 DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AT DIFFERENT TIMES is difficult to achieve in the best of times, but to do it in the Kolkata is a feat in itself. FLIPKART take a bow and gaurd against complecence.  A word on the telephine response - its good but not great but then i am comparing these to your own high standards. Measured against most other service providers it wud come up in the top five... 	5 stars	  16 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  I bought this TV on 12th Aug around 2 PM and got I scheduled my delivery at 7 PM next day. It was delivered right on time. Kudos Flipkart; as always.  Coming to the purchase, I bought for price Rs16,000 + 10% cash back through SBI card, that makes the price Rs14,400. Thats a good deal, isn't it. The delivery person was prompt and good. They delivered me to my second floor house without a fuss; and it was raining by the way. Appreciate the delivery person.  The Product: I was skeptical in taking a decision for a long time with the mixed reviews floating around on this product. Did a lot of research and came to a stage to take a risk for this price. And it paid.. I tell you, this is an awesome package for this price. Picture quality was outstanding and played almost all format files from my USB drive. Audio quality I didnot find any problem at all. May be it will take sometime to test out all the features. Absolutely satisfied for both Micromax & Flipkart service.  There are other models under Micromax 32" LED for a lesser price, but I don't think it will have comparative quality with this one - 32B200 HD.  My opinion: Good to go for a price anywhere less than 17K. If it is comes near to 20K then there are always other options. But otherwise its a great product; value buy. 	5 stars	  14 Aug 2014

flipkart.com	  I bought this LED TV via Flipkart about two weeks back. Absolutely satisfied with Flipkart's delivery as well as the product. I placed the order at around 12 PM and next morning at 8 AM, the product was delivered! The delivery guy even opened the pack for me and checked if everything is fine. As far as the product is concerned, Micromax is truly doing some good product development and coming up with above average products. I have been using this TV since the last two weeks and couldnt find any issue with it at all. The sound quality is also very good.  Micromax and Flipkart surely have one happy customer here with this sale. 	5 stars	  13 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  truly awesome TV, nice quality, picturization, pixel and all........  micromax a great brand now.  flipkart doing a good service too. keep it up.  	5 stars	  10 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  i have recd this product from flipkart less than 24 hr from the delivery time. i thanks to flipkart for delivering of this led tv so early and with proper items without any damage to it and deliveri is free of cost. i dont think it is possible for any brand to give this led tv in range of 17k  	5 stars	  10 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  1. Service by flipkart- amazing service from flipkart, including the highly professional ekart deliver people who were smiling and seemed trained for communication, unlike courier guys. - makes a difference.  2. Service by Micromax - I have seen many reviews about micromax not attending to people within 48 hours. I had a different experience though. This is among the highest selling model not just on flipkart but also elsewhere, and i had anticipated micromax may get delayed. I called their customer care immediately on delivery and requested them to send their person immediately. They obliged and i had the installation person at my house same day, and within 4 hours.  3. The picture quality is to my satisfaction. While SD movies, as expected may show a bit of aliasing, like in any other hd tv, HD movies were a treat to watch.  4. Sound - i have seen many people complaining about sound.. i think they should check if the "Auto Volume" option is the reason they are finding the volume low. In my case the loudness was more than enough for a 200 sqft room.  In USB video, there are some formats where sound is not played (i think where the audio is DTS encoded). Will be great if Micromax can come up with a software upgrade for this. Else the solution would be to play the movie on a laptop and connect it to the tv with a HDMI or VGA cable.  5. User Menu - I liked the simple menu of the TV which covers all the important controls. However for certain elements like "auto volume" and "power volume" i would have loved if Micromax could have these functions explained clearly in their manual.   Overall it is a great value for money product, and gives everything that a similarly priced swanky brand like Sony or Samsung would give at the same price. If you are not shy of showing Micromax logo in your main room, you can really save a lot of money and get this great product. 	4 stars	  10 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Very happy with Flipkart on the delivery promise * ordered on 28th July around noon and got the product delivered @ home the next day 29th July...Super show * there was an issue with the installation - was promised the installation would take place within 24-48 hours...but post multiple follow ups with Flipkart Customer Service finally got the TV installed on Saturday, 2nd Aug i.e after 4 days That was not a great experience.... 	3 stars	  06 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  I am using this TV for 2 months without any problem. Good picture quality, sound is also good. Yes it is too early to review an electronics product. Still, in this range or frankly within 25K this is the best TV. 32 inches samsung or any other company will cost over 30k definitely. So if you have got a new job and need a TV in your flat, or planning to buy a TV for 3-4 years, this is the best TV. GO FOR IT!! 	5 stars	  05 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  If I see the price for this TV, that is much lower then the other 32 inch LED. I have purchased this from flipkart around 10-15 days back. I am fully satisfied with the product quality and the delivery from flipkart.   But, the technician from micromax has came to install the TV after 3-4 days and after lot of escalations and followup. I am just worried about if I will have any problem in future, would I receive proper service from micromax? It is really a big question..  Thanks to flipkart to manage my temper at this kind of situation also by giving and asking me regular updates. 	4 stars	  04 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  The TV is alright for the price. Flipkart delivered real quick but they advised not to open the packaging until the Micromax guys come and install it. If you open the box yourself the 30 day return warranty gets void. I waited for 5 days for the Micromax technician to arrive and install the TV. In the end I had to take the risk and installed this TV myself. If Flipkart can get the installation done in time, this TV is a good choice. 	5 stars	  04 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  An indian product at affordable price...  Trust me people, you get much features for the price you pay.  My overall rating for the product is 8/10 and for flipkart services is 10/10. Neately packed, faster and timely delivery.  There is a delay in installation and demo by the company and the same be for any service related problems from their end to resolve.  A good deal for people who are looking for 32" LED HD TV at this price range. 	4 stars	  04 Aug 2014

flipkart.com	  Hi,  I bought a this model (Micromax 32B200 32 inch) TV in June from another seller(not flipkart). The TV was delivered to Mangalore. The TV was working fine but the remote was defective.  I tried looking for Service Center online and I find that Mangalore has no Micromax Service Center. I called up Udupi Micromax Service Center and they gave me the phone number of a contact person in Mangalore who has not yet set up his Service Center. I register a defective remote complaint in Micromax service through phone call. The person never turns up. I then decided to carry the remote to Bangalore and get the service done.  After 50 days, I register a defective remote complaint again at Bangalore through phonecall. The next day a service center person(I guess the manager) calls and asks me the address to send the service center technician. He gives me the phone number of the technician. I call up the technician and he tells me to call back after 30 minutes because he is busy. After 30min I call him up and tell him about the case number and I tell him that only the remote is available. He tells me that he will come the next day morning.  Its 12:15 noon and there is no call from technician. I call up the person and he asks me the number of days since I bought the TV. I tell him that its 50 days and he informs the same to his manager. He then tells me that the remote cannot be serviced without the TV set. I tell him that I have the Bill and the Warranty card with me. He hands over the phone to his manager. His manager tells me that they can service the remote only if its less than 30 days(don't know from where they come to this logic) and he says that he will charge me for the service. I tell him that the warranty is for 6 months and not having a service center at Mangalore is not the customer's problem. He tells me that he will send a mail to his manager and then let me know.  I called up the customer care again and explained my situation. He tells me that he will put my case on high priority. He gives me his manager's number and asks me to call him up and explain the situation.  Todate, the remote is still not repaired. I still wonder if all this hassle is worth it. I would have rather bought a TV with better service and brand.  The TV quality is good but you can't do anything without the remote.  I'LL NEVER EVER BUY A MICROMAX TV. PLEASE THINK ABOUT SERVICE BEFORE YOU BUY ONE. 	1 star	  25 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  For the price, you can't compare this set with anything else. I mostly use the tv as a giant tablet, connecting my google tv on it. Thanks to its multiple port options, it can easily become a smart tv, I have played hi-definition movies on it from my USB and the picture is absolutely stunning.  However, there are quality control issues that Micromax need to sort out fast. My TV came with a defective remote controller. Called up Flipkart and it got replaced within 8 days. After that, no issues so far. The delivery though, was as promised, within 2 days.  Lot of people are complaining about the sound quality here. Yes, the sound cracks after a certain level if you select the sound presets that come with the set. The speakers don't respond to bass well. I have sorted it out lowering the bass. However, these days I am using an external speaker. Frankly, LCD tvs don't have great sound if you are not paying well enough for it. This is a hell lot of package for the price and I am glad I bought it. Four stars for the lack of quality control issues. 	4 stars	  25 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  I ordered this product on Sunday and I received it on next itself.Thanks for Flipkart for the fast service. Micromax service engineer also contacted me in time for installation and it was also smooth. coming to the TV: I wanted a TV which suits my budget and i got it. It has nice picture quality , sound etc. It also plays movies with various formats like avi,mp4 etc. i connected my 500 GB hard disk but it did nt work . Rest is fine. I surely recommend this INDIAN Micromax product in future also to all my friends who are interested . I have to see the service of Micromax post installation. 	4 stars	  24 Jul 2014

flipkart.com	   Excellent delivery from flipkart. Flipkart arranged installation within 48 working hours as promissed. Coming to product. Using this from last 10 days, for 16k u can not expect more. But what ever you get in medium varient of sony and samsung u will get it. If you compare to sony video will not that good. But obviously reasonably video quality. Sound quality is also good for home use if you are not a music lover. I could not find any negative. 	5 stars	  19 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  You may certainly go for It.. M using the product for around 2 months now...And the quality of the product compelled me to review it...

You can't get better than this at this price at least..Last but not the Least..Product is INDIAN..So thumbs Up...Just go for It... 	5 stars	  19 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  This is an awesome product. Ordered it on 11th july 9 PM and got it delivered on 13th 10AM. The installation took 2 days though, but once installed, it is running like a charm. Superb picture quality, sound lags a little but it doesn't matter since it is a LED TV. A must buy for this price range. 	5 stars	  16 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  Definitely go for this product if you are looking for 32" HD ready screen. Excellent image quality. Sound is on bit downside, but u can always use an external speaker. Also, have problem in playing some .mkv files (no audio comes in that case). But, plays other files as butter. It is value for money. Got this delivered in 48 hr as promised by Flipkart. Also, kudos to Micromax team, they installed it in just 2 hr after the delivery. Great product, heavily recommended! 	5 stars	  16 Jul 2014

flipkart.com	  Having used LED and LCD TVs of different brands before, I was surprised at the quality of this TV.   It is a very good DEAL at this price and works fine.  Don't know why would people want to buy a 32 inch LED of a higher price anyway. 	5 stars	  12 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  I received the product in good condition. Installation was done perfectly on next day.  Biggest problem I found is with the video format it excludes. it lacks for mkv file format.  Rest is good as per the pricing.  picture quality is also ok. ( i only use it for movies through pendrive) sound is poor. ( i attached external sound speakers)   Overall.. its a value for money. 	3 stars	  12 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  Product was good and picture clarity is awesome and even I tried with usb 1080p movie it ran smooth.Price is worth. But the installation part took time as no one came to install so I did it myself. 	5 stars	  11 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  Picture quality is good,a nice product for the amount when compared to others.A better HD Technology ie Full HD technology or HD Ready technology and greater resolution gives the user a better picture clarity.HDMI ports allow users to play High Definition Content on the Television 	5 stars	  09 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  The TV was delivered exactly in one day. Excellent service, however the installation was not done even after 3 days. Extremely disappointed with the same. I got the new TV in exchange of the old one however still without installation. I hope flipkart takes notice of this that Along with the delivery of the TV the installation too has to be done. 	3 stars	  08 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  After using the product for 1 month i am writing this review.I paid rupees 16,299/- and ordered the TV on 30th May and got it delivered and installed on 31st May. This is what AMAZING about flipkart.Guys the delivery was just awesome and hasselfree. Kudos and 5 star to flipkart for the delivery.  Lets come to the PROS about the TV Very good picture quality, with NON-HD setup box also i am getting a good picture Sound is also good..I read some reviews regarding bad sound quality but i feel sound is decent (though i am using external speakers) I could be watch movies on my pen-drive..just plug and play If you are little budget constraints then i am telling you this the best value for money LED TV. I checked in Flipkart similar 32 inch LED TV are costing more than 22,000/ in average. Why should you pay more just for some style/brand, anyway the life of these LED TVs are not more than 6-7 years..  Lets come to CONS The style and looks is average For some file format i am not getting sound while playing movies through USB The remote is not universal..i have to use both Setupbox and TV remote  I will give 4 stars to the TV. 1 star missing for the looks.  In one line..If you don't want to spend your hard earning money just for style and brand then i recommend this TV to you all.  Now come to the interesting part..After using the TV for 1 week suddenly i had a problem with one speaker. Sound was not coming from one speaker. Then i called the FK customer-care.After doing some follow-up with them the technician came to my house and could found the problem. The problem was with the cable that connects from setup-box to TV. After replacing the cable now everything is working fine. I had an amazing experience with the FK Customercare for resolving my issue..and i wish FK to continue the similar service to customer post delivery of the product.  	4 stars	  07 Jul 2014

flipkart.com	  Flipkart deliver no doubt is faster & got delivered in 2 days. Micromax installation I'd doubts reading the reviews but the guy came within 48 hours 9:30pm night. Not sure this happened because I'm located in Bangalore and others cities have Micromax installation issues. I'd been an advocate of Mircomax(and people make fun of me for that :-)...) and had been using mobiles sisnce 2009(so far changed 3 mobiles... 1st one got stolen, 2nd one's display gone back because of my son throwing it around and currently usign Canvas HD ever since in came in India). So after some analysis finally thought of taking a bet to buy LED TV from Micrmoax for the first time  Coming to the 32" LED TV 1. Video quality: Went to Pai showroom to compare it with other LED TVs and I was amazed with this. 2. Sound: No need to comment... it's the low point of this product, but if you've a good home theatre system then can overcome this problem. I've done the same. 3. Connectivity: 2 USB ports working fine and even when I connected my 300GB external hard drive, it could easily read and play from that... one issue though when I connect HDD the TV switched off, but when I connected my normal USB key no issues seen. 4. Directly connected to my laptop & can work with the same and I liked that. 5. Most interesting feature what I liked that I can use this a Digital Photo Frame 6. Supports good number of video/audi formats so can directly run the videos taken on mobile.  Overall very very satisfied with what ever feature I got with the competitive products with this price range.   Only thing would be to see the life of the product as how long can it go without having to call the technical support for any issues. 	5 stars	  03 Jul 2014

I am very happy with this product and suggest to buy this LED with out hesitation. Wall mounting and other service is also provided by seller. 	5 stars	  03 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  @15800/- its a steal !!! A very decent LED TV 32 inch with great picture quality although it claims to be HD ready the picture quality is almost equivalent to a HD TV. The features are quite easy to use. The down side is the sound quality so my advice is add a good home theatre system to it and enjoy great picture and sound. A good buy over all if you don't want to spend a lot. Micromax service is however a concern I had to wait for 03 days and give a complaint to flipkart to get it installed. Flipkart service as usual is simply superb, this product was delivered to me in less than 24 hours of placing the order. 	4 stars	  03 Jul 2014

flipkart.com	  I got this product on time on 28-June-14 morning at 10 AM. I was told that the executives from MicroMax will call me and schedule a time for demo and installation within 48 hrs. Today it is 01-July and excluding Sunday, it is more than 48 hrs and I havent received any call from Micromax executives. The product is lying in the box unopened and I am not sure for how long I have to wait. I have called Flipkart team more than a dozen times and every time the only frequent word is SORRY and WILL GIVE YOU UPDATE IN NEXT 1 HR and the next i hr doesnt materialize at all.  The Micromax contact numbers come as invalid and flipkart doesnt agree. I dont know whom to blame, to flipkart or micromax. At the end of the day I am victimised after paying full amount. I will think many times before doing my business with flipkart. 	1 star	  01 Jul 2014

flipkart.com	  > No matter what video format's I throw at it, it buys it.  > 1 Exrta USB (not common among competitor's) > Fits the pocket. > Video quality is pretty descent and in par with LG's 32" LED  CONS :   > Sound gets sloppy at times (if used in a big room) - can be overcome if you are using along with extra speakers. 	5 stars	  22 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  EXCELLENT TV A++++++ WORTH EVERY BIT OF YOUR MONEY  MY RECOMMENDATION JUST BOOK IT BEFORE STOCK LAST  PICTURE QUALITY EQUAL TO SONY AND SAMSUNG I GAVE MY SAMSUNG 26 LCD FOR EXCHANGE BUT IT WAS WORTH THIS  DEAL OF YEAR I MUST SAY BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT GET 32 INCH LED TV FOR 14000/- AFTER EXCHANGE FROM OTHER KNOW BRAND LIKE SONY,SAMSUNG OR LG.WITH SAME QUALITY AS SONY AND SAMSUNG.SO IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY FIFA 2014 ON BIG SCREEN WITHOUT SPENDING HUGE AMOUNT ON TOP BRAND WITHOUT COMPROMISE ON QUALITY LOOK NO FURTHER JUST CLINK AND BUY!!!!! 	5 stars	  21 Jun 2014

flipkart.com	  Been a month that I'm using this TV and extremely satisfied with the product. The picture and sound quality is very decent. Ordered on Flipkart and was delivered to me in 5 hours flat! Take a bow, Flipkart! At 16,300, this is a steal. Go for it! 	5 stars	  20 Jun 2014 
flipkart.com	  This is very good TV for less budget and one of the best Indian TV i can say, same quality of the other brand TV's will cost us more that 25K, so why should we spend more on other brand TV's and why should we allow to flow our Indian revenue to other countries by purchasing other TV's like Samsung, LG, Panasonic, and Sony let us buy Indian Product and encourage Indian industries, Thank you Micromax for such a nice product and thank you Flipkart for your awesome service.  	5 stars	  20 Jun 2014

flipkart.com	  I researched a lot before buying this TV.  Its the only LED HD Ready TV under a good banner available at such a low price.  Picture quality is pretty good, you cannot compare it with LG/Samsung or other higher end models.   The only thing I didnt like was the sound quality, the sound breaks if played a bit loud, and I mean even for 60% volume, so you should buy a 2.1 speakers, other thing I noticed which is not very visible and hard to make out, the colour recreation is not that great, I had taken pics from my digital camera, the high reds appeared orange, it could be the hdmi cable also, not so sure about it.  Final verdict: Its a value for money TV, not sure about its operating life though, hope it lasts for 5 years and I get a good support from Micromax. 	5 stars	  17 Jun 2014

flipkart.com	  Firstly, kudos to the usual prompt Flipkart delivery. My product was delivered in the same time slot as was chosen by me suiting my convenience.  And now coming to the product. This Lg product is quite superior to it's competitors. Installation was easy-peasy and so far the experience has been above excellent.  PROS : 1) Picture Quality : Super!! Very pleasing to the eyes.  Although this product isn't Full-HD....but still even after being HD ready, it plays full hd(1080p +720p) videos flawlessly and the picture quality is just great. (Owing to the 32" size) 2) Viewing Angle : Surprisingly impressive viewing angles. 3) Sound : I guess the Sound has got to be this product's USP. If you have a small to medium sized room, you dont need to attach any kind of speaker-system at all. The sound is pretty clear even at Max Volume. 4) USB : There's only one USB port but it plays all kinds of files seamlessly. Even .mkv files which many high-end TV's don't (sadly). Until now I've successfully played .mkv .mp4 .avi .mp3. I even attached my 2TB external hard drive just to check and Voila!  Within a min it got detected and I was able to play all my movies & stuff. That was Amazing. 5) Remote : The remote is Non-bulky, handy and easy to understand & use. 6) Features : The features are quite user-friendly.  CONS : Haven't found any yet. There one thing that it has only one USB port, but I think I can live with that :D  So, my final verdict is that if ur luking for an LED TV under 25k with superior quality and amazing sound with all the modern features. This bad boy is a sure-shot Winner!! So give it a try and you won't regret it. 	5 stars	  21 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  Received it yesterday...the moment I installed, I was thrilled with the picture and sound quality. It's definitely one of the best LED TVs at this price range. Though it's ready HD, the picture is crystal clear and gives Full HD impression.   Thanks to all the reviewers who rated this and provided detailed comments. Reviews by other buyers helped me make this purchase decision and now I take this opportunity to join them in praising this master piece.  Total value for money. 	5 stars	  10 Sep 2014 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart deliver was very quick. Got it delivered the very next day. Although the LG came late and got it installed and demo from them after a day.  Overall, the TV is very good and I am quite satisfied: 1. The picture quality is awesome. Firstly I tried it on my TATA Sky box which was not HD, It was not looking very good. But then I realized it was non HD and I was using AVI output. Seems, its time to upgrade my set top box to HD. When I tried good quality movies from my HDD, I felt a sigh of relief, It was an amazing experience to watch. 2. Sound quality is OK. Can't expect everything from such low price TV. But overall the sound quality is satisfactory. We always have a option to connect other speaker/ Home theater. 3. The USB port is working fine. I was able to connect 1TB HDD and it worked very fine. I tried all the movie formats and it worked perfectly. The ideal resolution for the TV is 720p, but we can also play 1080p.  If you are looking for budget LED TV that has all the essential features, I would say go for it... 	4 stars	  12 Sep 2014 
flipkart.com	  Just got it. Nice product. Simple purchase & installation system.  >> Simply buy-it (from here I mean).  >> When it arrive, DON'T OPEN THE BOX (not a single seal; That's what I was told; That must be done by the LG Installation guys). >> Call Flipkart Customer-care, inform them you got the product (i.e. immediately after it is delivered to you); they informed me to call LG Customer-care. LG Customer-care took some details like, name, address, contact no, & mail-d, date of purchase, Model no.; Told me I would receive call from the installation guys shortly.  >> Got the call; they asked if I intended installation for table-top or wall-mount type. I wanted wall-mount; They came; Made approx measurements; Fixed wall-mount & TV >> Voila.......Just pretty awesome........Nice Customer-care for both Flipkart & LG......Thankyouuuuu. 	5 stars	  09 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  Hello,  I purchased this LED TV in last month from Flipkart,and called LG for Installation but LG customer care told me they will charge for installation & Demo around 500/- Srvice charge.  Which is not mentioned on Flipkart Site.  Lastly after 2 weeks of followups i installed TV by myself.  So confirmed it while byuing this product from Flipkart! 	3 stars	  11 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  This time flipkart has really screwed up. My TV was delivered on 26/10 and upon delivery I called up LG and they informed installing will not be free and will be charged. Called flipkart and they informed the back end team will take it up with LG and get installation done.  Followed up on 27/Oct and Flipkart agent informed to get it installed with LG by payment and submit the bill and money will be credited to flipkart wallet. I asked for refund to my credit card and the agent actually laughed (that's what i heard) and it was annoying. I insisted for installation by flipkart and case still pending.  Followed up on 28/Oct - and still the agent says back end team is working to sort it out with LG and installation will be done in next 24 hrs.  Will have to think twice before ordering any big item from flipkart. They still lack the competency to handle big home products and its irritating to have the product at home for 2.5 days and not being able to use it. Could have paid an additinal 1000 rs and got it from any store and it would have been installed in 24 hrs..  	1 star	  28 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  I purchased this product @ Rs 22990 :) on 11th Aug 2014. Awesome service and best deal provided by the flipkart. Product was delivered on very next day in good condition @ Mumbai. LG free installation service was also quick.  LG has made really good HD ready LED TV which have gr8 picture quality, loud n clear sound, fancy body and easy to use functionality. USB plays all the formats including mkv. Movies can be directly played from the external hard drive. I purchased this TV for my native place so I feel "ALL ROUND PROTECTION" comes with this will be good to have. I really recommend this product. 	4 stars	  07 Sep 2014 
flipkart.com	  I bought this TV as my tertiary requirement without doing my usual deep R&D. I have to admit that its my one of the best purchases. Flipkart service combined with LG makes this a safe buy. Do not expect all the bell and whistles in this price range however this one is not going to disappoint you at all. 	5 stars	  02 Sep 2014 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart delivered the TV exactly within my slot, the LG customer care agent was helpful and sent a guy within another 4 hours. Great job by all !  TV picture clarity awesome. Good and useful options.  Sound is sort of ok though. Anyway, these days an external speaker system is a great alternative. 	4 stars	  01 Sep 2014 
flipkart.com	  A prompt service by Flipkart and got installed(wall mounting) by LG within four hours of request.Picture quality is really good and sound quality is also great.

Anyways the product is very good and features are superb. Best Deal From Flipkart 	5 stars	  21 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have ordered this tv through filpkart the product was deliverd at right time the first good thing is filpkart packing its nealty and packed very safetly even the service engineer came for installation also said i never seen before such a good packing.so for packing 10/10.  Tv feature are awsome its supporting all the format of video (I am very happy that its supporting MKV format).easy installation and understanding .  Picture quality was crystal clear if your cable connection signal was so good other wise its dependens on your cable tv connection  But through usb you can enjoy real HD movies.  Sound quality also pretty good.  still now i didnt find any flaws on my LG LED tv. 	5 stars	  02 Sep 2014 
flipkart.com	  FLIPCART IS JUST DOING FRAUD TO THE CUSTOMER....ONCE THE TV IS DELIVERED THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THE INSTALLATION AND DEMO...EVERYTIME THEY TELL THAT INSTALLATION WILL BE DONE TODAY, TOMORROW, DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND THIS GOES ON. AND THE FUCKING EXECUTIVES GIVES ONLY EXCUSES....I WANT TO MEET THE OWNER OF FLIPCART AND SLAP HIM 100 TIMES. I AM CLAIMING THE AMOUNT TO BANK AND GOING TO CUSTOMER COURT FOR THIS FRAUD. 	1 star	  15 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  First the good part - Got TV delivered the very next day, and they took back the old TV (exchange deal). Installation request was raised even before delivery and promised within 2 business days. Now the bad part - Its the 6th day and installation not yet happened (old TV also gone). Not even a single call received from them. Multiple calls made to flipkart and with each call they escalate and take an extension of 24 hrs (false commitment). Some of them are even not sure whether installation team will be from Flipkart or LG. Waiting for the day when the new TV will be switched on (can't comment on TV performance). 	1 star	  09 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Don't get carried away by the discount show here/  Not really a good deal to buy this TV in Flipkart as   1. We have to wait for minimum of 4 days 2. Installation and demo + Wall Mount is charged by LG amounting to total of ~ Rs.2000.  This comes to the price for the TV in market itself while they in showrooms they give some compliments.  I made a mistake. Those who read it don't do the same.  	2 stars	  26 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Every thing is fine but LG people asking money for installation and wall mount. I heard installation and wall mount both are free of cost. With whom we have to check. 	4 stars	  14 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  TV got delivered but LG declines to install for free. They want to charge Rs.500. I am following up with FlipKart and LG. LG clearly says, they will not honor online purchases. I doubt if they will extend warranty. However the product description on flipkart site ways LB India provides 1 year warranty. 	1 star	  29 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  My TV was delivered as per schedule only nice thing. We had opted for the exchange offer but it did not happen (Filipkart knows why?). We were promised installation and demo within TWO business days but it did not happen. After many calls we were told that it will happen on 30-May at 11am (TV delivered on 26-May 9am). We waited full day but nobody came, just telling us that the person is on the way. Well the joke is that at 8pm some body is telling us that there is an entry that our house was locked and the service person says that since stand is out of stock he did not visit us.  Well I think I should have got it from the dealer and got better service. 	1 star	  01 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart Cheating Customers; Contexts mentioned on the website are false!!!!!!!!  Flipkart Cheats their customer and no customer service after purchase!!!!!!  Buyers please don't purchase products from Flipkart just for saving some money!!!!  I purchased this product on 30/04/2015 and it was mentioned that a person from LG will do the installation and demo but while calling LG they said it will be chargeable.  While calling Flipkart customer service, they said they will contact LG care and will get back to me but they didn't notify me anything and sent an unauthorized person i.e. a local engineer for installation.  I have called Flipkart Customer Service multiple times and requested to speak with a supervisor but no one called me back yet till todays date!!!!!  	1 star	  28 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Don't believe Flipkart when they say Installation is Free. You will have pay 2000 rs for the installation of the TV.  I called LG call center for the installation of My TV and they said according to their policy installation is chargeable. Raised this issue with Flipkart and they assured me that the installation will be done from their side with 5-7 days. But even after one month installation is not done. My TV is sitting inside the package for the last one month. Would have spent more than 1 hour fighting with Flipkart Customer Center team over the phone. Total waste of time and money. No resoltion provided even after one month. Flipkart please don't cheat customers by saying installation is free. 	1 star	  21 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Hi Guys, I purchased this product on 23.04.2015 and I have requested for installation in the changed address.Flipkart took time till 7th may for installation means almost 14-16 days.But installation is not done by 7th may.Again I called flipkart customer service for the same concern and they promised me that installation will be done by 9th may.But again they didnt stand for their words. Again I have called flipkart customer care,and they promised me installation will be done by 11th may at any circumstances.But they didnt done the installation.When I have called LG customer care,they clearly told me,they will not provide any service for their product which bought from flipkart. Flipkart customer care is really really bad and i am completely fed up with their service.Whenever I called customer care they used to transfer call from one person to other person and they used to keep my call on hold for 10-15mins.Today they are saying they can not able to do the installation and they can refund my money towards my flipkart account.After all discussion they are ok to refund my money towards my credit card.  I was about to order washing machine from flipkart ,but after all these I have decided not to buy anything from Flipkart 	1 star	  12 May 2015

flipkart.com	  I have purchased it from flipkart, I have got this product yesterday, its more than 25 hours, and still waiting for Demo Installation. When followed up LG customer care, they provided me the contact number of technician, and the technician refused to do the installation for free as it is purchased from Flipkart. Its really frustrating. When I called Flipkart customer care I got the response that I have to pay for installation charges. If I would have bought it from LG Store, or any other electronics store I would have got this product at 22,000 and with free installation. 	1 star	  06 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Not sure of the product though, as I am unable to use it; but having a terrible time with LG & Flipkart owing to installation of product. LG customer care says installation is chargeable as you have purchased on line but Flipkart website says its Free. When I spoke to Flipkart at their customer service number, they said they are arranging for an engineer to do the installation; but its 3rd day and I have not got any call from engineer to conduct the installation. I am calling Flipkart daily but every time I hear one excuse or other from Flipkart. (And everytime a same commitment to resolve the issue within 48hrs). Not sure how serious they are pertaining to installation. Flipkart is happy as they have sold a product & got their money (I opted for COD), though at an expense of an unhappy customer.  From experience, I would recommend, to buy from a local dealer, even if the price difference is close to 1k (as this being installation cost) as Flipkart is least bothered regarding post sale services. 	1 star	  23 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  Installation took 7 days. Flipkart does not have arrangement with LG for installation. Flipkart has got their own team who does installation and provide a fixed wall mounted stand whereas LG provides a movable stand with which TV can be moved to left, right and upward. So this is the difference of buying from E-commerce. Further, LG charges Rs. 500 for Installation if TV is bought from E-commerce, otherwise its free. 	2 stars	  09 Jul 2015

flipkart.com	  Not happy with the service of LG Engineer. First of all he does not know how to fix the TV that too on stand. If I have not intervened and shown him the correct location, he would have screwed my LED. Then, he does not provided me the wall mount. When asked, he said he does not know. Finally he came back today, but, dint provide me the wall mount rather than a local company wall stand. This is damm pathetic service I have came across from FLipkart. They should providel everything in the box and need to make sure that the Engineer who is going to come should be trained enough and genuine. Not sure if Flipkart team will going to take action after reading this. 	1 star	  19 Jun 2015

flipkart.com	  I have bought this TV a month ago. 4 star rating to LG brand and 0 star rating to flipkart customer service. Wall mounting was not done yet and its more than a month product has got delivered. I have called flipkart customer care and emailed them several times and no response at all. Poor and Worst service from Flipkart. I once again say "Never buy a TV from Flipkart" 	1 star	  17 Jun 2015

However it got installed now. I have spoiled 1 weekend and 1 day off from my office due to third grade service provided by Flipkart.

flipkart.com	  I have received the product from Flipkart. LG / Flipkart have outsourced the installation to a third party Jeeves who is absolutely pathetic in followup and almost impossible to get in touch with. It seems they are doing us a favor by installing the TV. I was made to hold, go around in circles and call several numbers and till now I have not found a resolution nor I have been able to speak to someone responsible enough to take an appointment and install the TV.  I am planning to return in to Flipkart if I do not hear from Jeeves in another day or so. 	1 star	  03 Jun 2015

flipkart.com	  I wish i could review the product but if the product is installed. Its been a week that product is delivered but installation not done despite of making innumerable calls to flipkart. Below is he history.  21/04 - Product ordered 23/04 - Product Delivered 24/04- Called flip kart installtion. I have been informed to call LG for installation. LG has demanded towards service charges. When called flipkart again, they promised that installation would be done from their side by 28/04. 29/04 - Called flip kart for status. I have been told that it would be done by end of the day or by 30/04 12 noon. 30/04 - Called flip kart for status. I have been told that it would be done by 6 PM   None has turned so far. I doubt if they will really turn up.   Never expected this type of service. I had great experience from flipkart earlier but this time you have let down badly.   Kindly do the needful atleast now. 	1 star	  30 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this product and was delivered to me on 20th April. On the same day I called to LG customer care for demo and installation. I was shocked when I heard from them that lg do not provide support(demo, installation and after sales service:warranty) to products purchased from any online store except lg band store. I informed flipkart the same, till date I haven't got any response from flipkart ben I wrote repeatedly. 	5 stars	  30 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  This is regarding my order OD102662795255945600 which is for LG 42PN4500 106 cm (42) Plasma TV, bought on 23rd April-2015. LG did not provide me free installation because it is bought from Flipkart and I had to cough up Rs 1603/- for it. Flipkart verbally committed to reimburse the amount but haven't done so far. I have already mailed them the invoice copy from LG.  Moreover, I visited LG service center and they clearly communicated that starting from this month, every product bought from Flipkart is out of warranty. They are asking for an additional payment of Rs 6084/- to get the warranty activated. 	1 star	  28 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  As mentioned in specifications TV is really good. My brother has bought another model of LG TV through flipkart. so far its performance is good. He suggested me to buy this model because this model has mobile connectivity to TV and two 10W speakers are inbuilt so sound is quite good. 	4 stars	  28 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I got the product and it is fine as I wanted. But the when I called up LG people for the installation of the TV, they had asked for charge of Rs.1300 for installatation as I baught the item online(started from this March-15 only as LG people say), this was shocking for me as I was told that it is freely done. When I talked to flipkart customer care they tell that u send LG people back we will arrange it free in 2 days. So I had to be with my TV not installed for 2 more days, then I believe they have arranged for people whom I should not say technicias!!! They have installed TV slantly and the wall mount kit was also very local which is not a genuine LG one. This was an horrible experience from flipkart and they have in turn my newly renovated wall to a great extent, they put the TV on single bolt and forget to put in the other, when asked for slent position, they used thermocol for the support!! I would suggest dont buy TV from Flipkart, I had a horrible experience with this , I have been asked to resolve the issue when I had discussion with flipkart representative before 3 days, till no callbak , no response!!!! 	1 star	  28 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  TV delivered on committed date. But still waiting for installation and demo. Called Flipkart more than 10 times. Every time same response "We have escalated your request and technician will call you today". According to info on website and information give by flipkart on call, installation will be done within 48 hours of delivery.  Product review will be posted after installation.  	2 stars	  27 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  For the first time SHOCKING poor service from Flipkart.   PLEASE take the TV back and refund my money.   I have repeated the following several times.  1. TV has not been installed even 5 days after delivery. While I have called daily no one from Flipkart has bothered to call or explain the delay.  2. I wanted to reverse the payment and use my Debit card to get 10% Visa discount. I have not yet heard on how I can do this.  3. Now I don't want this TV. I am trying to cancel the order and am told I can't.  4. Flipkart team has promised me that installation will be done within a day since 22 April. Each promise has been broken. Yesterday I had asked for an escalation and I was told I will get an email and sms of escalation. Almost 20 hrs later I am still waiting for this.   5. Flipkart staff has been erroneously advising me to install the TV with help from a local vendor. This is against warranty norms and guidelines. It is clearly a violation of their own rules.   6. I have also been advised yesterday and today to call LG for installation and Flipkart will bear the expense. I have repeatedly explained that ONE key reason I bought from Flipkart was to have some peace of mind. Moreover, on day of delivery I was told Flipkart will take care of installation.   So here I am - I have a TV which has not been installed, I have wasted atleast 30 to 45 mins each day since TV delivery, I have been told I did read instructions properly, I have not been given an option to reverse my payment (made by credit card) and now pay by debit card. I thought being a long standing loyal Flipkart customer (Flipkart First customer also!) I could expect better service.   	1 star	  26 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I purchased this television last month from Flipkart after reading all the good reviews, but after a months use I am ok ok satisfied with this one. I will go cons first and then pros: Cons:  1. Sound quality is AVERAGE!! Yes, speakers provided in the tv are of very low output, there almost no bass and had to struggle a lot with the settings to make the sound clear at least!! There is vey little difference between various pre-set sound modes. 2. I bought a 2.1 system to cover things up but alas!! output was not as good in that one as well, reason - this tv has only 3.5(headphone jack) to RCA connector!! This was confirmed by the LG customer care person who came to inspect on my complaint. Note - Other LG tv's which have "RCA to RCA" or "Digital Out" for sound are much better.  Pros: 1. Look excellent! very premium. 2. User interface of this tv is easy and convenient. 3. Play all formats through USB: I have tried MPED, AVI, MP4, MKV, event 1080p videos play without any hiccups. 4. LG customer care obviously, their representative came for installation within a day of purchase, and when I registered the complaint regarding the sound also the person came within a day, also they called back later to confirm whether the issue was resolved. What else could you expect!  Other things to know: - Even though this tv has the option to choose aspect ratio, many of the movies don't play in full screen, it's not tv's fault though! Its realted to the way movies are recorded. - When I connected my 1TB hard disk, voila! it corrupted some of the folders!! I was able to recover them with a simple command line check disk though, and came to know that hard disk has to be formatted with allocation unit size of 16kilobytes, haven't tried it though.  Verdict: If sound matters to you, please buy any other LG model!! 	3 stars	  24 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  Haven't started using the TV to the fullest. But the free installation provided by LG is not in par with the service they provide when the TV is bought from a shop. They have wall-mountable stand specially for online buyers, which is just a stand and very different from ones provided for the others. Why don't LG understand that everybody is their customer. Flipkart should do something about this. 	4 stars	  06 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  Purchased this product 3 months ago.. Have no trouble whatsoever, Picture n sound quality is awesome .. what else do you need from your TV ? Promises HD quality and delivers it - using it with airtel HD recorder.. works like a charm. The LG technician installed the TV in 5 mins flat... Dont think too much and waste your time on reviews on other forums - just go for it with your eyes closed. 	5 stars	  11 Feb 2015

The LG installer came in 2 days after calling him repeatedly.overall a good buy,so if you are looking for a led tv of 32" around 25k I recommend you this. 	5 stars	  05 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart deliver was very quick. Got it delivered the very next day. Although the LG came late and got it installed and demo from them after a day.  Overall, the TV is very good and I am quite satisfied: 1. The picture quality is awesome. Firstly I tried it on my TATA Sky box which was not HD, It was not looking very good. But then I realized it was non HD and I was using AVI output. Seems, its time to upgrade my set top box to HD. When I tried good quality movies from my HDD, I felt a sigh of relief, It was an amazing experience to watch. 2. Sound quality is OK. Can't expect everything from such low price TV. But overall the sound quality is satisfactory. We always have a option to connect other speaker/ Home theater. 3. The USB port is working fine. I was able to connect 1TB HDD and it worked very fine. I tried all the movie formats and it worked perfectly. The ideal resolution for the TV is 720p, but we can also play 1080p.  If you are looking for budget LED TV that has all the essential features, I would say go for it.. 	5 stars	  03 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Just go for it. And don't go for SONY if they provide for free of cost,because the user settings are not accurate as compared to the LG. LG is Very good in Picture Quality.And easy to use.Because i have Both the TVs in my house. And if you go to the any SONY Show room they kept the TV in Demo mode they are not in user mode so that we can see the picture at good quality which is not possible to view in home because it gives too much bright.and color production is high. LG is the best option ever............................................ 	5 stars	  03 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Awesome product by LG and also great picture quality. The only thing that is not prefect is the the display looking like pixellated while playing mobile shot 720p video on it. Also the images captured by mobile were also not looking so crispy that I had thought it would be. After all the TV's other features such as sound and video are great and viewing angles are also descent. 	5 stars	  02 Feb 2015

flipkart.com	  Its around one week and till now no one contacted to install the TV. This is one of the worst experience I have with flipkart. My TV is just lying ideal in the hall. I can't use it.

flipkart.com	  I have taken this tv on big billion day. The TV is quite good regarding picture quality, resolution, sound and other features.but there is one problem with this model is about the table mount.Table mount for this model is not a mono support type, its is dual support type, so you can't use this for rotation easily as in case of mono support type. if you go for wall mount there wont be any problem. apart from this problem the TV set is amazing. 	4 stars	  31 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  i got this from flipkart at an effective EMI of approx 1500/-. Can you beat that?

Have been using this product for a month now and enjoying every bit of it. Thanks to Flipkart, i was able to buy a great TV at the best price that any one in the market can dream of. A definite buy, but only buy it from Flipkart!!! 	5 stars	  25 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  After much research online and on the shops, I bought this 32in LED TV from LG. Online purchase and delivery from Flipkart was as smooth as silk. They purchased my existing 18 years old TV at a very good price without any fuss and gave me contact of LG service center for installation. The service engineer came home as per appointment and did wonderful job of installing and demonstrating the product. Its a different experience for us to watch the TV shows now. The colours and sound quality is pretty good. I personally feel that by opting to go for online purchase as compared to a shopfloor purchase, I got better price, chose the best model/brand for the price I wanted to spend and the whole experience was very convenient. We are very happy with our purchase and highly recommend this product 	5 stars	  19 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  pros:  1. slim shinny body, thin bazel and no cheap quality plastic. 2. amazing display, even if its 720 you can not . 3. good refresh rate on hdmi connection , i can play every pc game that my laptop can run with great fps. (ex, fifa 14, call of duty advance warfare, nfs, far cry 3 etc) 4. so many options to adjust display according to your choice.  cons: none except i don't like the remote   	5 stars	  15 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  Guys, This was my first biggest buy as online and was very happy it was worth it.. Was worried about online shopping but flipkart and WS Retailer is what you can count on, tv was packed very well and even delivery was on the time.  Now with the performance about the Television, i can say its worth the price you are paying.Performance is good, if you are not going for HD TV ie: (you have to set up HD setup box,have to subscribe HD Channels which charge you high and the should be above 32 inch to give you better projection)  In nutshell by spending Rs 23000-/ this TV is worth to buy... 	4 stars	  14 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  Purchased the set for 19.5k with exchange and discount program.  Writing this after 15 days of use.  Good TV at this price point. Could have been better if it came with two USB ports instead of one USB Port.  Sound Quality is acceptable.. For TV channels it is good. For playing movies, it is very low for few movies, for few movies it is very good. Might be due to the movie. 	4 stars	  03 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  I have a plan to buy Sony 21 Inch TV (Rs.24000)  In that Viewing angles are good and sound also. And i don't know about the USB reading capability of that TV. After that I saw this just for 23000(32'') Simply bought i have not did research. Ordered and got it 2 days before. Installed within hour. Good Sound, Good Picture clarity, Able to read most of the HD videos and formats. Viewing angle you can't see clear picture in 180 degree. other than that superb. My Baby watching rhymes in it. She always get engaged to it . 	4 stars	  27 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Best TV for this cost. Reads almost all formats of videos (including .mkv) . There is even an option to switch the languages like in computers for the multi-language movie prints. LG has changed the GUI to make it user-friendly compared to its old LCD TVs. Plus points: 1. Reads almost all video formats 2. Good GUI 3. Can turn OFF the screen when playing music. 4. Low power consumption 5. Better speakers (volume) compared to Sony models. No need for additional sound-box / external speakers. 6. The wall mount assembly is movable in side-angles. I can turn TV to face me in kitchen when cooking ;) 7. Picture quality is very clear for good movie prints. 8. Detects 1TB external HDD in few seconds. Isn't that awesome? 9. Got fast delivery from FlipKart. The packing of product was really good. Keep it up FlipKart!  Negative points for flipkart: 1. The offer said 10% cashback. But never recieved cashback on my credit card till I registered a complaint. On complaining, Flipkart gave the 10% back on Wallet (that compells me to spend 2.5k more on their website) - Not really good. Please give what you promise. 	5 stars	  24 Dec 2014

flipkart.com	  Very good product from LG, at this price. No FullHD, but justified with the price. It plays the HD videos, USB works well, channels work well as well. 	5 stars	  15 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Got the TV in 5 days . Installation done in 2 days. LG provides free swivel wall mount if your request them specifically. Useful for changing the angle of view and positioning the TV in the corner. other great features have already been explained in earlier reviews.  This TV has 20 watts of sound a compared to other models which have only 10 watts. Hence great value for this price. It also has IPS panel which comes generally in full HD TVs. 	5 stars	  15 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  After doing a little research on lg led tvs I zeroed down on this one and I ordered for this tv from flipkart on 5/12/14 and got it delivered the next day. I was supposed to buy it later but I got a very good price (Rs.15300 in exchange for my working led tv) so I bought it without checking out this TV in the showroom which would prove to be a mistake though.  Installation and demo was done within three days. During this period do not open the box as it will void your warranty and you may face problems if the piece is damaged.  Since I have a non-hd cable connection, when the tv was put on for the first time, the picture wasn't as clear as it was in my 22inch tv and it looked dull which disheartened me and over that, the LG guy presumably did not know that some settings can be done to get the picture quality as required. I later did those settings / adjustments of colour,contrast etc. and I got a good picture quality.  The audio output of the TV when on cable connection as well as when I connected my external hard disk to the USB port is very good and loud although there isn't any bass effect. The clarity, as I said is not very good on a non-hd connection and even when I tried playing hd movies by connecting an external hard drive it wasn't as good as expected. This may be because the tv is hd ready and not full hd so it has lower resolution. The tv comes without an adapter so it is more prone to damage in case of voltage fluctuation.  I thought that I had purchased one of the best tv's but that changed after I saw this tv in the showroom. Apparently this tv does not have a wide viewing angle which means the picture will change when viewed from different angles giving best views only for a small field of view in front of it. So if your room setting is such that the seating is not within this range then it is advisable not to go for this tv. And what is more surprising is that it does not come with lg's IPS panel so when you move your finger over the screen it leaves impressions making it delicate. These two negatives of the tv puts off the buyer, as being priced higher than the 32ln554a(which has these features) lg hasn't included them although they should have been present by default. Also the metallic finish of the frame looks cheap.  The added feature here is smart mobile link which I don't think is very much useful as it requires a mhl cable and a mhl compatible phone. Overall I would say it is an average tv and obviously worth the buy but I don't really expect it to last for long. That's why I'm considering taking an extended warranty. 	3 stars	  14 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  First of all kudos to Flipkart for its before time delivery and secondly to the amazing deal they gave me on exchange of my old LCD TV ( got 5k off ) wow !!!!   The exchange was absolutely hassle free as the Flipkart guys came and picked up the old TV and delivered the new TV , all done withing 10 mins.  Coming to LG 32LB563B 81 cm (32) LED TV the sound is amazing . Being 32 inch screen, its a delight for the eyes and the metallic frame adds to the beauty of your drawing room . Picture is absolutely amazing at this price .The LG guys wall mounted the TV with a revolving hook , at no extra cost , which comes in very handy when you want to view the Tv from different corners of the room.   Guys go for it and nothing else if your budget is within 21K. 	5 stars	  08 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  The Tv was delivered before time from flipkart and also did the LG service was very prompt. The sound quality is awesome.

flipkart.com	  First off all this time I was quite disappointed by flipkart service. Ordered the led tv on the big billion day offer of flipkart and received the product after 17 days that too by making several rounds of calls and mails to flipkart customer care. Coming too the Led tv. Its actually a value for money and I received the tv in an exchange with the old crt tv. The exchange was very hassle free and the delivery person were too good. Its about 20 days I am using the Tv. The picture quality is on the par with other tv around this range and may be better too. Sound quality is also nice from the 20watt speaker and for a small hall room no need of any sound bar or home theatre. Regarding connectivity too i must say its quite buttery smooth. Just connect the usb from the side and it gets qickly detected. I watched few movies using pd which were of 720p quality and must say the picture qualit was awesome. Watching sports like football and Cricket was also good. And the look of the tv standing on two supports is also quite good looking in my Hall. Overall a good product by lg and a value for money. Service by lg was also good and hassle free, just a call to lg, register your product and the next day engineer is home for installation. 	5 stars	  14 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  The product was delivered in right time in-spite of heavy rains. The price is very competitive compared to local retailers as they said close to 28k. LG technicians came on the same day of delivery as i called them before the product got delivered. Wall mount, installation and demo are completely free if said we have purchased from flipkart. About the product:  Pros: Good picture quality Good viewing angles Swill wall mount MHL  Cons: Sound a bit disappointment. Average output. But connecting an external speaker may solve this. Both LG and Samsung are of same in this case. If better sound output needed go for Sony.  Verdict: A great product and a great price tag. Go for it!!!!!!!! 	5 stars	  14 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Liked the product but not happy with flipkart customer care who doesn't know whether customer needs to call for installation or it is done by flipkart side. Installation took for me more than 10 days due to this miscommunication from flipkart side. Finally got this installed after 10 days 	4 stars	  11 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Hi All, today i purchased LG LED Model no: 32LB563B dated on 03/11/2014 from FLIPKART,after receiving product , i contacted LG care about installation and demo of the product, but LG care( 18001809999) people saying that no free installation/ no free demo/ no free wall mount or table tap stand, all are charged if buying from online website and no guarantee or warranty from LG. very bad info i got from LG Care & i immediately informed same info to Flipkart care( 18002089898).   please care if you purchase product from FLIPKART online or some other website 	1 star	  03 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  After a complete research of which television to buy, I chose this model. Some of the other models which was in consideration includes LG 42" Plasma TV, Panasonic 32" Led TV and LG 32" 3D Led TV! LG plasma TV consumes a lot of electricity (100-120 units of electricity approx for a month) and since I rarely watch 3D contents in my TV, I zeroed in on this model! Sony and Samsung weren't even considered because of the high cost and less features when compared to these Tv's. Coming to LG 32LB563B, Awesomeness is a perfect word to describe it  Pros: 1. Brilliant picture clarity - I could see every detail even in a 720p video! 2. It plays all the format including .mkv 3. In my opinion, SD quality set top box is more than enough to watch good quality channels. 4. Mobile connectivity through MHL are other added features which are not even available in other brands at this price  Cons: I didn't find any cons in this TV except for the low volume levels when connected to usb mode but it is negligible considering the price point and other features of the TV  As always, Flipkart delivered the product on time, So kudos to them!  Hence I would highly recommend this product!! 	5 stars	  02 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  I bought this TV (Model No LB750T) last month. When installing the TV, it had black dot on screen corner. The LG executive took some photo snaps and asked me to see if its causing problem. A week later, I started seeing horizontal lines on LED screen and I registered complaint with LG to repair or replace the TV. Its been 1 month and there's no response at all from LG. The price of the TV is 66000 and I am in a pathetic situation now regretting why I chose LG. 	1 star	  30 Oct 2014

flipkart.com	  First of all the product was delivered right on time. Flipkart always does that.  Now coming to the product. I got this TV for 21k under exchange offer and I am quite satisfied with the product. Family members were pursuing me to buy Sony or Samsung TV but I finally took a chance to go for this one and I would like to thank one of the Flipkart customer care executives who suggested me to go for this one. Here is a short and compact rating on the following features:  Picture quality: Great Sound quality: Good for me (as per my living room's size) UI: Good Installation: Done by the LG guys and explained the features quite well USB port: Just one. But I don't mind that yet. Also there is this power saving feature which enables the TV to power off automatically if it remains idle for 15 minutes.(I like it)  I have been using the product for 1.5 months and till date no problem.

flipkart.com	  I ordered this TV on so CALLED BIG BILLION DAY. After placing order, FLIPKART said the product will be delivered by next day. After waiting.. they updated that due to some issues, the delivery will be possible only on 15th October. They didn't even informed me this, they just updated the delivery date on there website. Now after waiting for 15th oct(more than a week), they still didn't delivered the product. Even the scheduled delivery is passed and no information yet. Flipkart is not even replying to my mails. This is really bad from flipkart side. I guess we need some consumer centric rules for e-commerce website which can fine this websites when they do not adhere to there committed policies. I am giving 1 star as of now, as I do not know how the TV will perform. FK, post this review  Tv is performing well at this point of time.. 	5 stars	  15 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  Hi,  When I placed an order I was told that the installation demo etc will taken care within 2 days by flipkart. After waiting for 2 days i called flipkart.  Now they are saying I have to call LG and process the installation and demo. I don't mind doing it incase I have been pre informed and still chosen the product. But to be told after a consumer has made a purchase is the most ridiculous online shopping experience.  You just are playing with the consumers trust. 	1 star	  11 Oct 2014

flipkart.com	  Its great to see the way they are customer centric processes. It looks like thousands of eyes at Flipkart are closely watching what a customer wants, how he expects the website to respond and they deliver accordingly. The updates at every step is amazing and I would say they under promise and over deliver. This is my 4th or 5th experience with Flipkart an they delivered it consistently - every time. Good Job 	5 stars	  01 Sep 2014

The delivery was superfast as always and wa delivered with in 30hrs.  The product was new, seal packed and opened by the flipkart delivery personnel in presence of me.   For installation need to raise a service request with LG and the installation was completed within 4-5 Hrs. 	5 stars	  13 Aug 2014 
flipkart.com	  The Product is too good. My rating is 4.6 out of 5. Reasonable Price. All Audio and Video Formats are playing well except .mkv video format.

Easy Installation. :-) 	5 stars	  25 Jul 2014

When i reached lg service they are saying we cannot replace the product as its 10days old, they can replace it only within 4 days. Flipkart gives a fake guarantee for replacement within 30 days. Now I need to wait for couple of days to get it repaired.. 	1 star	  22 Jul 2014 
flipkart.com	  I like to point out one major flaw about this TV before anyone jumped into this ;  Please Note : THIS TV WILL NOT SUPPORT 1920X1080P SIGNAL FROM YOUR LAPTOP/DESKTOP/MAC COMPUTER. IF YOUR PURPOSE TO CONNECT THIS TV OVER HDMI AND USE AS LARGE MONITOR, PLEASE LOOKS ELSE WHERE. BECAUSE THIS TV DON'T HAVE DVI SIGNAL PROCESSING SUPPORT OVER HDMI. YOUR ONLY OPTION TO USE VGA PORT WHICH IS RIDICULOUS IN 2014. FOR THE DEBATE SAKE YOU CAN CONNECT YOUR PC OVER HDMI BUT IT WILL RECOGNIZE AS ANY REGULAR HDMI DEVICE AND YOU WILL SEE BELOW STANDERED PICTURE QUALITY - LIKE CHOPPED OF COLOR ETC.   The above thing also confirmed by Service Engineer who came to my house for installing and demo. Already make a post @ Philips Support Forum ->TV Forum->TV Connectivity Section titled as "Philips 40PFL5059/V7 - Can't able to handle 1080p Signal from Computer ?" - Anyone can read the details.  Now it perfectly make sense why 40 inch FHD panel cost so less.   ---------------------------------------------------------------  Now my Review / Feedback - (after using for 3 Days),   There is absolute no word what Flipkart & Philips done together, From FK side all the discount and exchange offer with 12 months EMI - (Interest back as cash back) with additional 10% discount during X-Mass Eve is to Hard to resists - To my case product is delivered in very polite & professional way by the E-Kart team and the pick up of the old CRT TV done at the same time,  and once it delivered Philips after support activated and they even send their Engineer in my time/day of convince.   Pros : -  1. All other review mentioning picture quality is true - nothing to add here.  2. I found sound is quite sufficient for a such almost no bezel device - For regular TV watching it is adequate.  3. There is full composite out so you can hook any 2.1 system with this TV - You may need RCA-3..5" converter cable though in case of your sound system got no provision for RCA.  4.Despite many folks complains as well manual also say so - I found this TV support NTFS DRIVE over USB pretty much well - Though I agree there is limited codec support but the TV detect my two 1 TB drive 2.5" External (A-Data & Verbatim) very easily and play movie files from it along with Music & Picture.   Cons: -   1.Operating System of the TV is pretty basic - You get what you pay for - Very limited shortcut for adjusting Picture & Sound presets. There is no shortcut key for adjusting back-light - You need to go deep to adjust or control it.  2.No Eco mode or Auto Energy saving mode like Samsung, where you can adjust 3 steps back light value with the shortcut of the key.  3.Instruction manual was useless as well  4.For PC connectivity you must rely on VGA port as mentioned earlier.  5.No Firmware upgrade for future - You stuck what you got forever.  6.During playing video for the 1st Time from USB - it took 45 mins to figure out how to play the video Full Screen - at some point I start to believe there is no way to watch video in Full Screen at USB mode - and there is no info written at the manual about the same.  7.Not so well thought out Remote Design (here I mean to usage of the remote button) - There is literally no function for Colored keys (Red/Blue/Yellow/Green) unless you are stuck into Analog Cable Signal - No user customizable button either.   8. Great for HD content - but not so good for SD Content reason there is always over processing nature of this TV until you figure out how to tone down some of it's component.  Hooked up with TataSky HD+ connection and HD (sports) channels are truely shining with this TV...It really looks stunning but the same is not applicable for SD channels.  Despite of all this being 40" FHD panel with such offer from FK and the Manufacturer of Philips with 3 years warranty it is Highly recommended and very VFM for 2nd or 3rd TV at home with it's stunning sexy looks and gorgeous picture quality.  	4 stars	  31 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  THIS IS MY FIRST BUY WITH FLIPKART OF SUCH BIG AMOUNT. I WAS VERY DELIGHTED TO SEE THE LED TV BUT AFTER INSTALLATION I FOUND THAT THE TV IS UNABLE TO ACCESS HARD DRIVE DATA. THE TECHNICIAN TOLD THAT THE TV HAD RAM PROBLEM OK. NOW ON THE SECOND DAY THE TV WAS GOING WELL WHEN AFTER 2 HOURS THE TV GOT DEAD. IN FACT THE POWER LED ON THE TV WAS ALSO DEAD.I TOLD FLIPKART ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND THERE COOPERATION WAS VERY GOOD.THEY RETURNED THE DEFECTIVE TV AND REFUNDED THE THE WHOLE AMOUNT .  I WILL DEFINITELY RATE 5 STAR SERVICE FOR THIS QUALITY BUSINESS.  	5 stars	  23 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Thankyou Flipkart for the excellent deal at Rs.29.3K  Pros. .Very thin and beautiful display.. Watched movies in Full HD format.. WOW !!. .The most beautiful TV as far as I have seen.Trust me even Sony(My fav), Samsung and LG don't have an offering with extreme thin bezels(border) which was my requirement. .The horizontal Philips branding part looks very premium kind of design.. .Detects USB drives very fast. Movie play is hassle free. .Table mount and wall mount are very beautiful. .Sound is loud enough with DTH connection.  Cons. .Low USB movie play volume with select movies only & some movies sounded loud enough.I overcame this limitation by connecting 2.1 music system using 2 RCA male to 3.5 mm stereo female cable to AV out. Works very fine.  Very very happy with the purchase..  Excellent value for money.. 	5 stars	  27 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  Received the TV within 1 day of ordering, and just another day more to get it installed. Awesome service as promised by flipkart. Happy about it.  Would begin with one negative, probably this is by luck in my set, received a faulty remote control (not quite faulty, but it misses the spring in battery chamber, the Philips executive has made it work makeshift with a conducting wire, and has promised would be replaced soon). Anyways, it does work fine currently.   Coming back to the TV,  1. The design and aesthetics is simply awesome. Probably this being a very latest model (Released in September/October 2014), the looks and design impresses way beyond any other tv in this range.  2. Picture quality is simply superb, While the HD channels have got a different dimension of clarity, the SD channels have got a finer touch as well (Pardon, if I am being too biased, but this being a personal opinion as compared to my previous LCD tv and other tvs I have tried out). Haven't quite tried out Samsung/Sony Latest products, so won't comment on the comparable quality of this. 3. A lot of reviews have spoken a bit negative on the sound, but I feel okay with it. Yes, it hasn't quite got superb bass/treble, but c'mmon if that is the audio quality we expect, we can always go for a home theatre, lets not be harsh on the TV for this. 4. 3 Years Warranty is an added advantage for this TV 5. The TV has got quite good response time and hardly lags in detection and mode switches  Well, what else do we require from a TV? 40 inches LED TV from the Brand of Philips, with a 3 Years warranty for which I paid 24.5k (after my old LCD exchange), I am quite happy about it and would definitely recommend 	5 stars	  17 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  I got this one for 30k after availing an exchange offer. Good service by flipkart. Product is fantastic in basics, but you know where you saved those 10k over other brands once you start using it.  Pros :  - Looks fantastic, stand is made of some really heavy metal and feels durable and sturdy,(we have a Sony Bravia 40inch at its stand was partially made of plastic)  - Does a fantastic job of producing image. Clarity of Standard definition is at par with Sony/Samsung products. (It also depends a lot on the cable network and the signal strength). HD content is reproduced well and is comparable to Samsungs/Sonys/LGs  - Volume levels can go pretty high, but the sound itself is meek given the slim structure, no bass or high frequency notes are audible only midrange is good. The 'incredible surround' technology is brilliant. Connecting external speakers highly recommended to experience it.   Cons: - Out of the box functionality is limited. No options to customize color temperature manually, though there are 4-5 fixed settings to choose from. The display is so bright that your eyes will feel strained watching bright content (Like a test match, snow laden scenery etc) at nights with all lights off. Unlike Sony, there is no utra-soft preset mode which reduces brightness and contrast which strains eyes at night.   - One USB connection only.  - GUI is very old and feels like built-to-cost. It covers the entire screen.  - Power source has the circuit for DC conversion built inside the TV, unlike Sony where you have a laptop adapter like arrangement, if in an unfortunate event, there is a power surge and that circuit is damaged, you will have to give the entire TV set for repair. Voltage stabilizer is recommended although not necessary if there are no voltage issues in your home.  Summary : Definitely worth the money. Infact, the asking price outweighs all the cons I've mentioned above since you will be saving around 10k compared to its competitors. For that 10k you can get a great 5.1 ch speaker system.   Hope it helps. NJ 	4 stars	  16 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  It is a best product and best deal in market.  Very good HD clarity Good sound Easy to access Not complicated operations  Tip: If you want surround round go for 100W+ home theatre or soundbar+woofer 	5 stars	  03 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  I wanted a Full HD TV with a 40" screen. Saw the great reviews of Philips 40PFL4958 which is a 2013 model. This a 2014 model and a very recent launch on Flipkart I think.   Flipkart delivery is superb as usual.. Bang on time.. Though I hold a small grouse on the not so courteous male CS exec's who couldn't give me accurate info on the exact delivery time.. Booked on the 21st evening and delivered on 28th as promised. Exchanged an Old CRT for this beauty.  The installation by Philips staff was excellent. very curteous, knowledgeable and prompt.  First things first this one is an absolute stunner.. The slim bezel and beautiful finish is absolutely stunning..   Here are the pro's -   1. 40" FHD LED tv @ 28k.. What more can one ask for ?? 2. Very Slim and stylish. 3. Picture quality is very good. Video's played from my pen drive and HD DTH  are simply stunning.. 240 Hz motion is good and did not find the soap opera effect as   prominent as I had thought. 4. 3 year Philips warranty. 5. Very decent inputs.. 2 Hdmi, 1 Component, 1 AV and Usb. 6. UI is quite fast, pleasing and intutive. 7. Pen drive / external HDD was recognized in a jiffy and playback started fast and is   quite smooth. Played Big movies ( Over 2-5 GB ) smoothly.. No stuttering.. 8. Normal digital cable STB also gives a decent picture.. ( No upscaling ) 9. Lower power consumption compared to the older model's ( 75w vs 100w )  Cons..   1. Sound quality is weak as is expected from slim LED's. The sound is quite tinny and   totally lacks any Bass.  I would gladly recomend this TV to anybody looking for a budget LED TV with no extra frills.. It's a steal @ the price being offered.. Thanks to Flipkart for once again giving an absolute bargain and superb service. 	5 stars	  02 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  About Flipkart: Rating : * Philips 40PFL5059 was available Rs 29990 on 24th and then it was available for Rs 30990 on the day of electronic sale (25th May) with 10% off option with Axis Bank and that too is not working. I made the purchase hoping that I will get discous of 2500 Rs with Axis card payment but that too was not done and had to call the customer care. Now they are saying that it will be credited to my card account in some time.   This is rediculous, why to put fake sale if you have to increase the price and then offer some silly discount which also dont works...   About Philips TV: Rating : *** Philips 40PFL5059 is awesome for this price, very nice display, good picture quality however features available with this tv are very less. Menu options are very basic and navigation may make you feel like if you are using some old TV. My previous 32" Philips LCD had more options than this one like, color temperature, RGB adjustment etc.  No 3.55 sound output available which is big time let down and you have to use RCA cable if you want to connect external speakers. I felt 3.55 was giving better sound quality than RCA if you are using HDMI as source.   Overall, not bad deal. 	2 stars	  25 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Loving this and a great deal at a great price. Flipkart delivery was on time.  Pros:  Great Picture Qualityon D2H HD, USB as well as PC through HDMI.  Sound is good enough for D2H.  TV design and stand looks beautiful.  Philips the brand.  Price.  Cons:  Picture settings are somewhat limited, can't calibrate the individual colours independently.  The menu UI not the best to say.  Thanks Philips and Flipkart. 	5 stars	  02 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  The product is really awesome it's worth for money, while comparing to other brands like LG, SONY, Sam etc... Philips is giving this product for less money and the brand value is also there, Also from flipkart we will be getting 3years of warranty it's really great,  Pros. More than value for money 700rs per inch . Very very thin edegs and it's very slim. Table mount Stand looks very sexy and the build quality is really awesome. Sound is good with DTH. USB detection is very fast and the video play very smooth. Less weight while comparing to other products. 240HZ motion is really great you will feel it in the HD videos.  Cons: Will update later :)  	5 stars	  28 Oct 2014

flipkart.com	  Flipkart's website is good...offers are also good that lures buyers..but the problem starts once the product has been purchased...  Also just realised that Flipkart only puts reviews with good ratings on product pages -- other reviews are just junked...giving 5 stars so that atleast prospective buyers will be allowed to read my comments...  1. On product page, they promise next day delivery..(while there is a disclaimer that some delays are likely due to festive season) and by the time you are have made payment - they ask you to schedule a delivery which is by default 5 days down the line...nonetheless, a customer choses a preferred time and schedules delivery 2. Till the date of scheduled delivery, no alerts or intimations are send to the customer on status of the order 3. On the day of scheduled delivery, the customer stays home all day to receive the product but nothing arrives...(though a mail arrived in the morning saying you will receive the product today as per your scheduled delivery) 4. the next day, the customer goes to work and the doors are locked...meanwhile he has informed the Flipkart Customer Care multiple times to please call before coming for delivery....but these requests of customers are not heeded....the delivery guy reaches the delivery address and calls the customer....The customer has to leave office in a hurry creating a mess as the delivery boy says that he will not be able to come back later...  5. after that, while the customer somehow manages to take the delivery, he is asked to not open the package and wait for Philips installation guys...he is promised an installation in 24 hours...  6. Now, after more than 24 hours of delivery there is no update on installation...later (after 24 hours have elapsed and the customer has been calling Flipkart for help all through) - an installation update is sent which says that installation will happen over next 3 days...  7. Now 2 days have passed - and I am sitting with the package waiting for installation as the Philips guys are yet to call me....  WAITING ENDLESSLY AT THE MERCY OF FLIPKART An order placed on October 21 is delivered on October 26 and installation is yet to happen...  Had read multiple reviews that spoke about Flipkarts quick delivery and installation support but MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN PATHETIC......While I have been calling Flipkart every now and then to seek updates -- there is no mechanism to provide updates to customers...also all customer requests are just ignored...  YET TO USE THE PRODUCT AND REVIEW THE SAME 	5 stars	  29 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  I purchased this in late December 2014. So it will be completing it's 8 months in few days. Pixels on all four corners, plus edges on left and right looks burned. If you do not know what is pixel burning just google. basically those pixels are showing little grayed image. I knew it's not an IPS panel as will have issue with viewing angle, but if you see from front exactly, still you'll see these grayed images, specially visible when nearby pixels are of the same color. It's still in warranty(Flipkart said 3 yrs!!!) but Philips says it's a problem with this model. I don't think that's true, it wasn't the when I bought it, I feel. So my advise is to not to go for this model. People might argue that I've not used it properly and should know burning period, I know what is pixel burning and used it as suggested for initial 200 hrs. Philips won't repair/replace this and you'll stuck with this. I hope this helps in making your decision. I see many people are praising this for it's contrast and black behavior, that was the reason I bought this. Genuine advise, avoid this. 	1 star	  23 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  Fully satisfied with the product. Using this product since last 1 month and face no issues with any function like playing movies from 2TB external drive or DVD player, connectivity with laptop. Voice is louder enough for my 10' x 12' room.  All in all it is a worth buy for me.  The only issue faced with extra warranty of 2 Years. Called several times to Philips and Flipkart CCE for same and every time these guys assured me that my product has 3 Years of warranty, hard copy or soft copy (email) will reach to me this or that time but didn;t get anything as proof (written). let finger crossed to get warranty information in writing. 	5 stars	  23 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Hope this would be my last transaction with Flipkart, they promise extended warranty for 2 years from Philips.  This is false information, I have registered my details on Poweroftwo website few weeks ago and yet no details.  Called Flipkart & Philips customer care, they are passing the ball.  TV is good but Flipkart & Philips are fooling customers with false offers.  Thomas 	1 star	  19 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Hi, I am a fan of Philips brand and looking at great offers on this tv set I was very excited to buy this tv,got 40" Full HD with an old tv replacement amounting all to 30K approx. However I dont find the picture quality good. All picture seems to be a little hazy and not crystal clear. I tried to apply different settings as well but as already mentioned by some one that the picture settings are limited to which I agree. I am a little disappointed from Philips. Flipkart sale and delivery is absolutely fine, however philips peaple take 3 working days to come and install(sunday is a off),I waited for 3 days and finally called up philips customer care to send some one to come and install on urgent basis then they send their person for the installation. Overall, I was not so happy with the picture quality and I raised a return request . Then some one from flipkart called me and promised for philips technician's visit to my home to see the problem. The philips technician came home and re-flashed the ROM and after that the picture quality got improved and its really good and I am happy now :) 	2 stars	  03 Jun 2015

flipkart.com	  Was searching for LED TV since last 1 year. Had been to dubai and singapore but did not bought even though the price were attractive. I wanted to buy from india bcz of warranty coverage.   Initially zeroed down to Micromax but after a bit of thought found this model of Philips... Fall in love at first sight ... Very sleek ... Thin bezel....Crystal clear vision ... Stunning performance....  Price at Philips store was 49K, they were ready to offer discount upto 2K !!!! I got it at 29K with exchange on Flipkart...   Delivery of flipkart is super speed....... The person who delivery was so courteous and soft spoken.... For installation i had lodged a call with philips as soon as i order TV, hence the technician came within 10 minutes of my TV delivered at home... Got installed within 10 minutes...   One month passed, enjoying the TV fully. Checked TV by attaching every gadget to TV and found working absolutely ok...   Now comes best part, i got it converted to "SMART" TV just by attaching Google "CHROMCAST" for mere Rs. 2500/-. Working absolutely stunning with iphone/ipad/laptop...We are enjoying youtube/vimeo/daily motion videos .... From laptop google chrome ... watch unlimited movies online without download on viooz.ac   I would advise people not to go for any high cost so called smart TV. Just buy CHROMCAST and you are thru... provided you have high speed (>2Mbps) at home. send me a message i will help about CHROMCAST.  Rush and get this TV before it's sold out.......  	5 stars	  21 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought the TV without even seeing it physically so there was always that i was taking. So after taking that leap of faith with Flipkart since it was being sold by WS retail i was not so worried. Delivered well within time and setup was done as scheduled. very happy about that.  Why i bought this TV? 1. SIZE. I moved from a 4 year old 32 inch LG to this 40 inches beauty. Actually there is hardly a difference between the 2 TVs as this one comes with a very thin or almost no border as compared to the old 32 inch TV. The stand is also quiet cool looking and strong.  2. QUALITY. The FULL HD picture quality is great specially because of the 240HZ refresh rate. In common words there is almost NO blurring of fast moving objects, specially the news scroll which can give you a headache if blurry. you can actually read the news and came handy while watching Delhi poll results :D I recommend using a 240Hz compatible HDMI cable.  3. INPUTS. i am glad it has 2 HDMI ports. very useful when you connect your Set top box and have an option of connecting another device like a WD MEDIA HUB or a CHROMECAST too.  4. EXTENDED WARRANTY. Most TVs come with 1 year warranty and you pay 4-7 thousand to extend it for another year. in this case i got 3 years with the TV that costs appx 34K. Thumbs up to philips for that. i feel more confident of the product while buying.  NOW what i am not happy about  1. SOUND. Is VERY low yes VERY VERY low. no base at all and i am not some sound expert. just to normal ears its odd after listening to a regular LG TV for so long.  2. Only1 USB. i was hoping for another one. Don't know what i would have used it for but at least one more.  3. Placement of ports. I genuinely think that port need to be behind towards the base and not on the side. its just more convenient and you can do away with the mess cables create. now with the port on the side the cables are seen more in my case as i have not mounted the TV on my wall.  Overall if you are going to connect external speakers or a sound bar and are okay with the cables looking a bit messy i recommend this TV. 4 stars (One less for bad sound) 	4 stars	  17 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart as usual on time and excellent delivery! Mind you they got it in 12 hours. Next day installation by Philips!  I have been using this TV for almost a month and found all the features to be sharp and excellent. Quality depends on source! Sd set top box would give mediocre quality for some channels while excellent for the others. HDMI input gives excellent sound and video experience.  PS3 games have an excellent and seamless flow. Loving this TV for clarity with blu-ray (PS3). Connectivity:- Sufficient HDMI's (2) and 1 USB. Constraint:- With TV on Wall mount adding and removing cables is an issue. Sound is decent and I dont see any sound issues when I watch varied programmes on TV. All connectivities work seamlessly. I connected my Laptop through HDMI and was stuned @ colour reproduction and clarity. You can use this TV as monitor for your laptop / for watching movies. (Connecting through HDMI input on Laptop would be better).  Menu options are basic. But you do get all that is required!  Very Happy with this purchase.   	5 stars	  12 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Excellent TV for a very user friendly price. Don't be misled by the price, quality is absolutely top class. plays all formats from 1TB hard disk. Coupled it with my tablet through HDMI and using it as Smart TV also. 	5 stars	  23 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  Its been 3 weeks since this TV arrived at my home. My experience as below:  Flipkart Service: Just awesome !!! From ekart shipping to installation follow ups to Philips was very good experience. Impressed with Flipkart  Philips installation: Not so good (at least in Pune). Technician was too rude, Installation call got cancelled 2 times because he came without notice and wanted to install TV when i was in office.   Coming to TV Pros: 1. TV is lightweight and with thin bezels, looks good aesthetically 2. Picture quality is comparable and even surpasses other brand Full HD tvs (ensured this in showrooms before ordering Online :) ) 3. 240Hz motion rate, though not usable practically for now. Good to be future proof  4. Power Consumption (70W) is even lower than that of 32 inch TVs 5. Standard and enough connectivity options (HDMI, USB, Composite etc.) 6. Price in budget and the biggest plus 7. 3-Years Philips warranty :)  Cons: 1. Audio - Volume is enough but there is no punch, it is quite flat (no bass or treble effects). I knew this before hand (from showroom) but accepted since i already have 5.1 home theatre 2. UI is very basic - nothing much to customize or play with. However, preconfigured settings will suffice daily usage 3. Cannot change video format (4:3, 16:9 etc) when playing videos from USB source. Only TV channels will allow you to do so  So if we consider price and if you already have good sound system. Go for it !!! 	5 stars	  13 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  This was one VFM product. I was bough tin offer where this tv was 33k and i was given 7k in offer which includes exchange of my portable tv (which flipkart took for 3k) And the purchase was for Rs 26800. What more can it be a 40' LED FULL HD TV for 26K :-)   Awesome picture quality with HD DTH. Made Chromecast connected, and it is a smarter TV for the price value of 30K.   Wel Done Flipkart. 	4 stars	  03 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  Excellent Service from Flipkart team, I have already recommended my   friends to buy from Flipkart. Delivery was very quick, (Ordered on 23 Dec and received on 26 Dec   as promised). Demo and Installation was also done on very next day. Product Philips LED 40PFL5059/V7 is very good,  Picture quality and Sound quality is also very Good. (Most of the   reviews says that sound is very low, However I found the Sound   quality is very good, My Living room size is 12x18, at just keeping   the volume at 30 point is enough to listen. I also got 3 Years extended warranty registered on   http://www.poweroftwo.in/warranty.aspx, Received the confirmation "Philips LED TV Warranty just got   upgraded!" 	5 stars	  30 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Bought this beauty with 20% discount on Flipkart First Day. Kudos to Flipkart and Ekart for offering such an efficient exchange service. They delivered it within 48 hours and installation was done 3-4 days later. Flipkart CC followed up until the installation was done. Very nice.  Positives: 1. 40 inch FullHD Philips @ 26k! 2. Simple yet elegant design, just the way I like it. 3. Picture quality is impressive, to say the least. I had already prepared a USB with few HD movies and video files with various formats. And to my surprise, it played everything except few files with DTS, Opus and 10-bit AVC. Very impressive! 4. Menu UI is simple and efficient. As is the Remote. 5. NTFS support. Manual does say only FAT16, FAT32 is supported, but one day I accidentally put in a NTFS formatted flash drive and to my surprise, it was detected and I could play everything in it. After that I tested couple of portable 2TB drives, and both worked flawlessly!  Negative:  1. Sound. Flat, hollow, tiny. It's tolerable while watching cable, but I could barely hear some of the movies from USB, even at 100 volume. Fortunately I had my decade old Creative Inspire 4.1 lying around. Plugged it in and since then TV sound is kept at zero.  About the warranty, Flipkart says 3 years, but Philips manual says 12 months. Philips technician said that you need to register on Philips website for warranty. So I did, but there's no mention of warranty there. When I registered my Philips AquaTouch, there was clear mention of three year warranty, so still not clear about the warranty period.  Overall, quite satisfied with it. Highly recommended for its elegant simplicity and picture quality, but keep your speakers or home theaters ready if you want the sound quality! ;) 	4 stars	  29 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Purchased a Philips 40PFL5059 LED TV from the 5000 Series from Flipkart and was delivered on precisely on time. Flipkart Advertises that the Installation and Demo of the Tv is done within 48 hours from the delivery of the product. I received a text message from Flipkart saying you have been booked for the same and that i will be receiving a call from the manufacturer.This was false since i did not receive any call from anyone regarding this matter. As i made a complaint against this i was Emailed that i needed wait for 2 more days and that i have been placed on priority basis. Philips technician finally arrived on the 6th day and installed my TV.  I am not sure how serious Flipkart is about their customer service but one thing is for sure that Flipkart is false advertising their services. 	3 stars	  03 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  This TV has everything and nothing. If you prefer only screen then its the best  Pros: Great Picture quality Sound is good but bass is too poor Price  Cons: No one mentioned it doesn't support NTFS file system but rather FAT32, 16 common a decode old technology, which is big letdown. you have 40 inch TV and you have to watch video of less than 4 GB size   No system to upgrade firmware means you are stuck with what you get and will have no features upgrade.  	2 stars	  26 Dec 2014

flipkart.com	  Overall TV is good, picture quality is nice. Sound quality is also Average. But the biggest Disappointment/Flaw is that it do not recognize any USB( hard disk) and reboot the TV. TV automatically reboots when we connect the USB drive. I have tested it on multiple drives and the issue persists for all. Flipkart team has been informed on this issue and exchange with same/other brand has been initiated.  	2 stars	  04 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  This TV has poor color reproduction failing horribly when compared to the likes of LG or Sony TVs.The sound system is just average and by no means satisfactory.The price is a bit low compared to other models available,but does this not even justify this low price tag.Overall,nothing good in this model except for the screen size.Please don't waste your money. 	1 star	  04 Oct 2015

Cons: 1)Little disappointed with TATA SKY HD.Only HD channels are looking good.Would suggest for Airtel HD. 2)TV Sound will disappoint you..better connect a good sound device 	4 stars	  14 Sep 2015 
flipkart.com	  The T.V. is simply awesome, simple to operate. Picture quality is amazingly great. using it with HD setup box and believe me you can not get this brilliant quality even in highly priced T.Vs available in market. The USB port can detect External HDD upto 500 gb (never tried beyond this capacity), can play almost every format of videos and audios. Truly awesome HD TV at an amazingly super price.  Delivery and installation support from flipkart was great :) 	5 stars	  12 Sep 2015

flipkart.com	  Its been more than two weeks when I bought this products, delivery installation was all done on time. As far as TV is concerned, its the best piece you can get at this price with confidence of Phillips. Picture quality is perfect, looks really good the only thing you may have to compromise on is on its Sound. Sound is good when a normal TV is being watched however under USB mode sound goes really slow and would require external speakers to have audible sound in USB mode. 	4 stars	  06 Sep 2015 
flipkart.com	  I ordered this as BDay gift to my dad on 7th Aug and promised delivery date given to me as 14th Aug but delivered on 20th Aug then there is no followup on installation or demo after long email chains and multiple calls several escalations it didn't happen i paid by my pocket to get the TV installed after 11 days on 1st Sep a guy showed on doorstep for installation which is toooooo late Few points i would to mention here 1.

flipkart.com	  I bought this product a few days ago after lot of research over the net. As far as display is concerned this is a very good product at the price it is being offered. I had also visited some of the showrooms of different makes to see their price but finally decided to go for this product because of the PRICE, FEEDBACKs from previous buyers and the PHILIPS brand. After using this product I feel I have made a right decision. Similar products are offered by other Big Brands for not less than 40K-45K (some of them offering a 2.1 speaker with this TV) in the showroom which might come down by 5K-6K online. But still this one is cheaper.   As far as FK is concerned their service was great and the price I got was around 27.5K after discounts and cash back from Credit Card. The delivery guys were also very punctual. Since I wanted to check for damages inside they opened the box in front of me showed me everything and again packed it back to original condition. FK had booked the installation for me before the delivery and I got a call from the service centre an hour before the delivery. Since it was almost 5 PM they could not schedule the installation that day itself but was scheduled for the next day. But I could not wait for that and did all the installation myself.   Detailed feedback about the TV  Pros. 1. Great Display 2. Value for money 3. Very sleek stand and a very thin bezel.  Cons.  The only problem I find with this TV is the audio quality. There is almost no Bass. But I think this problem exist with many other LED TVs in this range in the market since it is difficult to get a rich sound in these sleek TVs and I found the same in the showrooms as well. That is the reason why they are offering a free 2.1 speaker with the TVs. But when I connect this TV with my existing Sony D8 it simply rocks.   Since this is an "UN-SMART" TV I connected an Apple TV with this to make it SMART. A perfect combination.  Would definitely recommend if someone is looking for a good display product (without some of the frills offered by other brands) and at a good price. 	5 stars	  16 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  I had purchased Philip 40 inch LED last month. As usual, it was delivered in time then communicated by flipkart.  I LED is great and the installation guy came the very next day and installed it.  The picture quality is awesome. The only problem I found is with the audio when listening to the music. It is a bit loud. I feel that you have to connect external audio if you are a music lover 	4 stars	  12 Aug 2015

flipkart.com	  I am really very please with the product & that too at a reasonable price ! The colors & clarity are truly wonderful ! Thanks for the service too . 	4 stars	  08 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  Purchased this a couple of months ago. I am happy with the product, nothing much to complain, except the sound. Since I already have a 5.1 system, it was not important for me. But if anyone one is looking for this TV, will need a better sound system, otherwise you will be disappointed with the sound, so add a minimum decent 2.1 sound system to your budget. There is no 3.5 mm sound Jack, which would have made things easier, but nevertheless, u can get a cable from anywhere. TV looks good with think bezel. Pic quality is very good, but I didnt compare with a Samsung or LG side by side, so I dont really know the difference. Connects with USB without any issues, but u will need a cable as the port is in backside, not easy to reach when mounted on wall. 	4 stars	  07 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  The picture quality is exceptionally well.The HD channels from Airtel DTH are displayed with great clarity.  Weight is very less plus this comes with a 3 years extended warranty( I got 1 +2 years free in an offer) from Flipkart.I got the product delivered almost the next day and within two hrs someone came to install it.  The product blends well with my Philips home theater. Sound quality is good without DTH but when you use a DTH you should keep the volume to the maximum.  I saw couple of Blu-ray quality movies copied in a pen-drive and It was super awesome. It gave me a theater kind of a feel. Stunning colors.  Cons: Audio Quality is Bit Low (when connected to DTH) But Yes Easy to Add-on Home Theater system  Bottom line: Overall a value for money. I brought this product for 27K (Actual price 29.5K - Cash back of 2500 plus 2 years extended warranty)  	5 stars	  07 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have used this TV for 3 months before writing this review. Bought it in a cashback + interest free EMI option. Below is my point of view:  Pros: 1. Excellent picture quality for Video devices like STB, Blue Ray and DVDs. 2. Fair audio quality, If you feel it is low, call customer care and they will increase it for you. 3. Nice look. 4. Plays most of the video formats through USB disk, however I felt audio sync issues when I Forward the movies.  Cons: 1. Back panel not accessible while TV is on Wall mount provided in the box. 2. Poor Remote and interface design. I am really puzzled with this remote and interface of this TV. 3. No headphone out socket. 4. Only 2 HDMI ports, though for the price it is OK. 5. Bad color quality while using PC over HDMI. Had a hard time convincing the Philips engineer, but once he understood, he found the new firmware, adjusted the color settings and the color quality is fine now.  Earlier I had a Sony TV and after using that I don't feel it can compete that, but keep in mind that you get what you pay for. 	4 stars	  06 Aug 2015

flipkart.com	  This TV is what i always wished a TV to be ... very good TV in a reasonably price. Clarity is nice....though low on sound but that can be cured by adding a speaker system. Other than that no flaw at all..the menu and remote is also very smooth.I seen many other top brand TV';s performance also at my relatives place...so comparing that...it is not over priced...and also has all the features. 	5 stars	  31 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  I'm writing my review after using this TV for over 4 Months - It's been so good and I don't see any problem with the TV. I was little concerned about the volume before buying, but it's okay. Sound clarity is good but not great. If you are music lover, I think you should go for an external speakers.  Overall, I'm happy with this product.  As always, Flipkart has been doing the great job by delivering quality products with competitive prices within in the mentioned timelines. 	4 stars	  29 Jul 2015

flipkart.com	  Well it's been 4 months since I bought this Philips 40PFl5059. I believe now it's an ideal time to review it.   Pros ------- 1. The thin black bezel gives a very rich look to the TV. It's light weight, sleek and adorable in design. 2. It comes with one USB and 2 HDMI port which are easily accessible from behind. 3. Some small handy features like screen freeze and subtitle control. 4. The 240Hz PMR gives a great Full HD experience. (I can tell being a movie buff) 5. It supports almost all video formats hence no compatibilty issues. 6. Its a decent non smart TV in its budget. 7. It just took me a Chrome Cast to make my TV Smart. :) 8. Never played around much with the Picture setup hence can't comment on that   Cons ------- 1. Much has already been told about it. The sound is a real spoiler for this TV. You cannot imagine to watch this TV unless you have a decent sound   system to plug-in. I just saved myself on this with my 5.1 channel Philips music system. 2. No subtitle controls while playing videos from USB. Simply On-off option which is very basic. 3. The TV lacks few basic features like Music mode(audio only with screen off) which was there even in my old CRT TV   Flipkart delivery was bang on, cheers for that. I ordered it on Thursday and it was on my doorsteps on early Sunday the scheduled day of my delivery. I even got an exchange of 2000/- on my CRT as well. Sweet. :)   Summary ------------- A good non smart TV for a decent final price of 32000/- with exchange offer. 	4 stars	  22 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  This TV gives lovely viewing experience. Picture quality is great. Sound is loud enough for TV (DTH( viewing however its very low when watching movies on a USB stick. Need an amplifier here.   Placements of the ports if bad in case of wall mounting and its almost impossible to insert an USB stick.   Otherwise an amazing product at this price point. 	5 stars	  21 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  For the price, you get a good 40" LED tv that too from a renowned brand. To add icing to the cake, you get a 3 year warranty also. What more do you need? Thanks flipkart for providing us the item with a very competitive price. 	4 stars	  19 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  I am using this product for more than a month now. Here is my feedback.  Pros: 1. Prompt delivery by Flipkart. I have scheduled the time 8 AM to 10 AM, the delivery came exactly by 8.05 AM. 2. Installation was also prompt by Philips service center.  3. Picture quality is superb. I don't find any issue with this. especially when you are watching HD channels, the picture clarity is excellent.  Cons: 1. Sound is real bad. When I keep the sound 30 or 40, still I don't hear the voice clearly. It is like sound is coming from a well. I keep increasing the sound, both in Tatasky setup box and TV, but still it is not up to the mark. You really need a 2.1 or 5.1 home theatre system. Otherwise you will not feel enjoying a movie eventhough you are watching in HD. 2. Accessing the USB Port is very difficult if you do wall mount. There is no space between the wall and the tv. You might need to remove the tv from wall mount and insert your USB drive.  Overall, I love this product except the sound features. 	4 stars	  19 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Dont believe flipkart in this case. They dont have proper communication with Philips.People never come for installation even after 12 days of delivery. Every day calling the customer care centre and fighting with them inspite of paying the money as well is not customer's head ache.  That too hearing the same statements daily like "We sincerely apologize, we understand. It will be done in another 24 hours. Please wait for another 4 hours", you will soon become mad. Dont give false statements like installation will be done in next 3 business days after delivery if you are not able to. 	1 star	  17 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  I am very much happy with the product I purchased. Also Flipkart done a wonderful job. It has been more than 3 months I am using the TV. The picture quality and the sound quality is excellent. But when you use PENDRIVE to play any song or movie the volume is not audible. In that case I am using speakers, For this reason I am giving 4 star. Overall it is an excellent product to buy. 	4 stars	  16 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  The quality of the product is amazing and comparable to established (read expensive) brands with the only exception of not having fancy features. It seems to have all 'regularly used' features with a good picture quality. Even if the other expensive brands have a better PQ, the marginal difference does not justify an additional price of around Rs. 16,000/-  The catch is with the FK service. I ordered the Product on 1st June 2015 when the same carried an additional warranty for 2 Years (3 Years in all). After confirming about the same from FK executive on call, I went ahead and placed the order. After using the product for about 10 Days, I was informed by a Philips executive (who installed my product) that the extended warranty was not applicable for any purchases made after 31st May. On raising the issue with FK, the company admitted that the offer was displayed incorrectly "due to a technical fault" and agreed to process a return and refund the amount. I gave them an option to compensate an amount of around Rs. 4500/- to me which I would have used to buy the additional 2 Years warranty from Philips, since, I did not consider it a sensible decision to waste a Rs. 30,000+ product when the same did not have any technical issue. The executive did not agree with me citing an obligation as per their 'Terms and Conditions' and initiated a return process.  Probably, because of FKs erroneous product listing, I lost an opportunity to own a good product in a good deal. Since, the same offer was being flashed till a couple of days after 31st May during an Electronic sale, there might be more buyers who might faced a similar issue. 	2 stars	  15 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Everyone covered all PROS and CONS and it is same case for me too... Biggest plus is Picture clarity and Biggest Minus is Sound (But good for small rooms).  Apart from that it is irritating to connect USB and other ports if you wall mounted, which is actually present back side of the TV.   If they give movable stand for Wall mounting, it is Awesome Awesome Awesome TV.   Want to add one more point - Worst Philips Service... Not able to complete the two years warranty in poweroftwo. Raised an complaint and waiting for past 15 days, no one is really interest to close it.. So one star less for that 	3 stars	  15 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have bought this product on 31st May and on that time I was getting 2 year extended warranty as free , but till today I am struggling to get warranty . I have called multiple times to CC but no proper response.  Now I have planned to return this product, because I feel that flipkart has cheated me.   	1 star	  12 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  I watched champions league final b/w barca and juventus on it . It was coming on TenHD and signal was coming from outside India therefore quality of the vedio was far better than other HD channels . For most of the time , I found myself gazing at the TV rather than on the match and that too in a champions league final , so you can imagine the picture quality .you just need to feed it the a better signal , rest it will handle .  Can't be compared to soy/samsung as they make non-hd chanels too look good with their brushing and finishing technologies , as are their costs . 	4 stars	  10 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Received this product last week and I have to say that I am really impressed with this tele. Picture Quality is Top Notch with HD channels, SD channels are decent. Have been using a Panasonic 720p Plasma 42", I belive that SD channels look little better in that (IMHO).  A lot has been mentioned about sound quality of this TV, but i found the sound quality to be adequate if not amazing!  Be it the Audio or Video, the options are limited, but again all around quality you get with this product off the box settings are more than enough, so we dont have to play around with the settings. havent got a chance to test the USB and other ports, will provide an Update on this later.  Verdict: Excellent value for money Product.  Thank You Philips! 	4 stars	  08 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  The site says that installation would be done in 3 business days. 8 days after buying this product, I am yet to even receive a call regarding installation , let alone get it installed. I have called up Flipkart support 5 times in 5 days with little effect beyond the usual platitudes of "we will get it done tomorrow for sure". A deeply frustrating experience. 	1 star	  05 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Philips for me was a more trusted brand than VU or Micromax, they might have good products but did not pass my check.  40PFL5059 was my choice after lot of research on panel quality etc. This is imported in India from Philips manufacturing plant as per my research.  My Purpose was to Connect this to my XBOX and Chromecast and use it as entertainment system in Lobby for watching movies, playing games and not for regular TV usage.  Due to the purpose, full HD was needed along with higher Refresh rate for fast moving games. Only Philips has 240 Hz PMR (which is supposed to be actually 100/120 Hz) for India Standards.   Received perfect Delivery from FlipKart in 2 Days, and they delivered in selected time slot, which is just great. 10 out of 10 to FlipKart for Service, Support and Delivery.   Pros: 1) Amazing Picture Clarity for Blue ray and Full HD Movie Prints (240 Hz PMR matters). Score 8.5 out of 10 2) Great Gaming experience. Score 8.5 out of 10 3) Amazing Looks, better than Samsung for sure and looks great with Matt finish Metal Table Mount 4) Great Looking Remote (It matters to me) 5) Narrow bezel and thin form factor in spite of being a D-LED (I prefer D-LED more than Edge LED, as Edge LED will need lot of good technology to give correct color reproduction on full screen) 6) Great Sound with HDMI connected devices  Like Google Chrome Cast and XBOX. Score 8 out of 10 (As in built media playing software does not have good sound reproduction) a. Service Engineer will need to adjust Sounds Curve Setting for better sound, in case you have trouble please call Philips and tell Engineer to Set Sound Curve correctly. 7) Philips Brand and Great Price. Score 9 out of 10 a. Unlike LG and Samsung which charge for Installation if bought online, Philips considers FlipKart as a good buy and installs in time and gives full warranty.  Cons: 1) No Head Phone Out, difficult to connect regular Speaker or Wireless head phones 2) HDMI Ports very close to each other cannot connect Chrome Cast and other another HDMI cable together, one extra inch would have helped 3) Build Quality is 7 out of 10 4) Philips Support. 7 out of 10 (Difficult to coordinate with them, specially was extended 3 year warranty) 5) No way to turn on or off the Higher PMR (Frame rate). Looks like LED automatically decides based on frames coming in.  Recommendation to FlipKart is to please show pictures of any such electronic product from all angles so that one can see the ports placement and other important angles of TV.  I would Highly Recommend this TV for Regular TV usage and Great Picture quality. (Ensure that you get Sounds curve Corrected for Service/Demo Engineer). FlipKart as always performed great on delivery and Support.  If you have an HDMI player (Chrome cast/WD player/ASUS Play) to play movies and music, nothing beats this LED for Price it is offered at.  Thumbs up to Flipkart and to Philips  	4 stars	  05 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  hi this is ajath i purchased this led full hd tv looking so nice and display super  totally its good 	4 stars	  03 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Hello, This product from Philips is awesome. I like the picture quality very much with a HD connection. Sound is little bit low but in a room or hall it is sufficient. But when playing movies from USB, sound is very low. If you connect an external speaker then it will become a nice home theater with very low price but good quality. I like the bezels of the TV. It is looking nice and very slim. Delivery from Flipkart is also very good.  At last I would like to tell that if you compare the price with other branded TVs in the market then this is the best one to choose. 	5 stars	  02 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have brought this product very recently from Flipkart. This is really amazing product. I have played movies from USB as well and the display is amazingly superb. I had only one concern that was about sound, but I have overcome this by connecting LG2.1 Sound bar. After this the movie experience has been amazing. I have visited many showrooms to see the picture clarity before placing the order in FK, I was stunned by the quality as it was on par with the quality of samsung/sony. I would definetly recommend this TV. 	5 stars	  27 May 2015

flipkart.com	  Pros : 1. Amazing picture quality HD is just amazing 2. Very thin 3. Looks really premium 4. Plays all formats  Cons : 1. Very very very flat sound, comparable to the sound of cellphone literally (To watch movies from USB you will have to attach atleast a 4.1 speaker system) 2. The OS is some 10-15 years old, not mutch options as well  Such amazing picture quality, but a shame that the sound is just pathetic. 	2 stars	  23 May 2015

flipkart.com	  I had bought this TV in a haste, however I am not dissapointed.  here's my review  Pro's: >Picture quality is great, the sharpness really gets you when watching high end videos (720p/1080p) and also with HDTV >beats the competition with price. >its Philips, so I presume quality >easy install and manuevrability >They have provided 2 HDMI ports which is certainly useful ! > Stand provides a classy look if you dont mount it/  Con's: >Sound quality is good, however the volume is pretty low for a TV of this size, better buy a 2.1 speaker system atleast and connect it via the AUX ports >For some reason my TV keeps turning ON as soon as its turned off (Ghosts?) and I need to turn it off the 2nd time ! (am I doing something fundamentally wrong here?) >Viewing angle is not that great, however thats expected from a LED TV.  All in all I would recommend this TV to a friend considering the price 	5 stars	  21 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  received in a single day, Amazing delivery service. Installation done on the same day.  Picture quality is very good, Even the cable tv looks amazing.

flipkart.com	  Pros: The LED quality, overall fit and finish is really good.  You don't get anything like this (40.2inch Full HD LED) in price point like this Fully supported by Phillips India- Its not an imported product.  Cons: Poor delivery timeline by Flipkart. Made me wait almost a week for delivery. If you need it urgently, don't buy it here. Audio quality isn't really good as compared to a Samsung or a Sony. But for normal home use, its average. The remote layout isn't very user-friendly. However, if you look at the overall package, you don't really mind these. 	4 stars	  17 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  sound is okay,  picture clarity is good,  nice and slim led tv at this price, and brought this for 29k without exchange of any old tv...  delivery bit delayed. but everything is good... 	5 stars	  17 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart Delivery:- Superb Fast, on time slot delivery like most of the time. Delivery Person was very polite and courteous (the best delivery guy i ever met so far from any e-Comm seller).  Product:- LED is Good looking with Sharp picture quality.  Voice is OK OK, not that bad as said in many review comments. {could be better but still ok }  USB reading is fast and able to play all specified format of picture and video {Specified only :-)}  Wall Bracket:- This is not very good actually for This kind of Super Product. bracket is very simple and can be use for hanging only, no rotation/movement possible. Could have been lot better.   But Over All Very good FHD tv such a half budget from competitor.  4.5 Star is must.  [This review is based on initial 2 days, will post more detailed one after few days.] 	5 stars	  16 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this TV before 6 months. Received within two days. Same day, the installation staff came and installed immediately.  Very sleek border and width. Easy wall mounting.  I have connected this TV with my PC via HDMI cable. Wonderful picture clarity. I am able to watch FULL HD videos without any lags.  When playing movies via USB, it plays most video formats including mkv. But if the mkv file size is more than 4 GB, audio not coming. I dont know the reason.   Regarding sound, it is ok. We should not expect more than this sound quality in any LED TV. Attach a Home Theatre to get better sound output.  Overall I like this product very much and satisfied. 	5 stars	  14 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  When I made this purchase Flipkart offered 3 years product warranty on this TV. Now I've gotten this product delivered and installed and now Flipkart can't find any traces of evidence that they promised this warranty.  Would highly suggest to take a screenshot of what is offered on this website as later there is no way that Flipkart is going to honor their service commitments. 	1 star	  13 May 2015

flipkart.com	  Didn't get even single call from delivery man. I was in Bangalore only with 24/7 mobile switch on. After 3-4 followups Flipkart is saying your order has been cancelled as I am out of city. I think even they didn't try to deliver to product.   I have ordered this product using EMI offer which is EMI charges cash back. I think this is game by Flipkart and Delivery company(May be this is also by Flipkart) 	1 star	  05 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Writing the review after 3 months of usage : 1) Brilliant picture quality 2) You can connect any 2.1 Speakers to it ( very simple ) 3) Menu is straight forward 4) Remote is pretty good. 5) Convert to smart TV just by buying the Android TV dongle.  Got this at 22.5k on the big bang day sale, so cant really complain for the price.   Really happy with the TV's performance.  	5 stars	  04 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Ordered this on 28th April got delivered it on 29th. Flipkart Arranged installation request with philips & got installation done on 30th. All butter smooth & in a professional way.  I ll highlight what i was searching everywhere before buying this  It Works with USB 2.0 (i am using 32 GB pend drive) for movies music etc. Wasn't able to read HDD 500GB. You have to purchase HDMI(Male female) & USB (Male Female) cable before getting it installed on Wall.I wasn't able to see difference from my old Samsung LCD with this in terms of 240hz motion flow.Neither you ll find any option to check it if its on or off.While planing movies via usb there is no option to change the ratio 4:3 16:9 letter box etc..  Biggest issue of this LED is volume..Its on lower side..(if your room is big)  All in all if you are looking for value for money LED buy it !! 	5 stars	  01 May 2015

flipkart.com	  Very good picture quality, awesome product. Very satisfactory service by flipkart. Thin bazzels all around the tv gives a very pretty view. 2HDMI and 1VGA port is really needed for my personal purpose. If you are watching a movie through a pen drive, sound is very low in this TV. Suggest to buy any 2.1 speaker and connect it to get a wonderful TV viewing experience.  I am totally satisfied buying it. 	5 stars	  30 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Good Price, but Audio is too worse, those who are looking for good audio should avoid this product The Audio is exhbiiting as if someone is talking from deep well.

flipkart.com	  Have listed down both pros and cons which would help buyers to buy the same.  Delivered in 2 days time . Installation happended next day. Fast delivery and service. Purchased in the month of April 2015  PROS 1. cheap compare to Sony, LG, Samsung  2. 3 years warranty. You get initially 1 year warranty, later you need to register with philips by providing  serial number of TV. 3 years warranty you will get via email. You need to take print out of this soft copy. 3. Only 70W power consumption. Others they consume 85W to 100W  4. HD channels are superb and clarity is good with TATA SKY HD.  CONS 1. NO rotating wall mount.Tv is justed fixed into the wall. To put pen drive you need to remove TV every time 2. If you buy extension USB cord it will not detect external Hard disk like 1TB My Passport as TV does  not generate enough power.  3. only USB pen drive works with extension cord. 4. Only 1 USB port given.  5. Sound is loud enough but it doesn't have sub woofer etc hence quality of sound is very bad.  You must put external speakers for quality sound 6. After warranty expires service cost is costliest among all the brands. 7. NON-HD channels are not great. Not sure if the same case in other TV's 8. No applications installed or WIFI etc. It is just basic LED TV  9. Need to spend Rs 1700 extra for stabilizer 10. For rotating stand you need to send Rs 2100 extra 11. Does not play any Blue Ray RIP via USB. Most of the HD videos are in Blue RAY RIP. You need to buy separate blue ray player. 12. If you get HD movies which are generally of 5 GB , you cannot copy to pen drive as pen drive supports maximum 4GB file.  you can copy to external hard disk but is not recogized by extension USB cable. In other words there is no way   you can play HD videos via USB.  Overall Good product if you can't afford Sony,LG,Samsung.  Instead of going to other local brands buy Philips by just paying few thousands extra and get warranty for 3 years and your investment is safe for 3 years.  	3 stars	  28 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  big TV at reasonable price ,specs are good, but u need to have a HD connection orelse it would spoil your TV viewing experience.  One more drawback is that if you wall mount your TV the gap between the wall and the TV is very less hand gets stuck and thus restricting us from inserting Pendrive and HDMI cables. 	4 stars	  25 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Screen quality is very nice , even sound is great. Works super smooth & experience rich with HD input.  Pen drive response time is less, and the remote has very few options.  Direct led GIVES great colour reproduction. Better than micromax , videocon anytime. 	4 stars	  24 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  Have been using for past 3 months. After a lot of deliberations, decided to buy this against Samsung 5100. No regrets; except u need a Home theatre for a better sound system.

Not bad at all for SD channels. 3 years warranty is the ultimate deal sealer for me. 	5 stars	  06 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have been using this TV bought from Flipkart for almost 5 months now. Here is my ten cents or paisa  Video 1. Full HD is decent but dont know in comparision with other brands 2. The colour reproduction is good and its close to natural which is why I preferred it. But viewing angles are not great. So if you are more likely to watch in a straight angle this is ok 3. Colour adjustments are medium, you cant play much.  Audio 1. Sound quality is nothing great and is like a CTV speakers. Suggest to go for a HTS 2 The different media settings is of not much use  Menu controls The remote is good and ergonomic. But the on screen menu is very basic and looks so outdated Does not support connecting your smartphone to watch movies  Design The front design is sleek and slim but accessing the back parts is a big issue.. and they dont provide with a proper wall mount.. its just 4 rivets on the wall to fix the TV 	3 stars	  01 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought my 40 inch LED TV in November 2014 and from 2015 March end I started facing issues with television. TV is getting switched off automatically after random duration of hours. Lodged a complain in Philips and after committing the technician visit within 24 hrs, technician came after 120 hrs. They fixed saying we have installed some new software and now we will not face this issue even again and soon after 3 hrs of leaving, i started facing the same issue again.  This is certainly not expected from Philips as superb brand. We got TV by thinking Philips is a good brand and we will not face much problems. 	2 stars	  01 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  1080p resolution at low cost. No where we get. Picture quality very good in 1080p format. (even in low resolutions). FHD DTH channels are awesome. Very sharp crystal clear picture quality. I bought it 3 days back and started recommending this product to my friends circle. USB reada very quick. VGA connected to pc gives good picture quality even in low resolution. Supports all common formats of video. Sound quality lags very much that one cant expect in philips brand. But this sound issue solved by connecting DTH audio out to 2.1 home theatre. I surely recommend this 40PFL5059 to all Indians. Kind request ... dont go behind the so called top branded TVs and paying a huge money just for its branded name...  I was amazed by the Flipkart followup and delivery. Packing was excellent. Just in 2 days I received the product. Also the cashback offer in EMI is a good move by Flipkart. Hats off to Flipkart. Yeh Flipkart, we are here to support you, go ahead in your service. 	5 stars	  24 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  For the price you pay, you get an awesome picture quality and sound quality (I connect external F&D speakers). Thumbs up for that!!.Here are a few negatives i noticed. 1. Sometimes, when I connect my laptop through hdmi to the tv, the picture quality is not good. The laptop simply restarts at times. Dont know if that is an issue with the laptop or the TV 2. Phot viewing: There is a limit on the number of photos you can view one after the other - I guess some 30-40 only. The tv does not even detect more photos on your usb pen drive. This is wierd, but true. 3. Th user interface they built, is a kiddish job at best. Can be much better, when you pay some 30 odd thousand. 	3 stars	  23 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this TV three months back from Flipkart, as usual the delivery was on time and installed in a single day. Initial stages i have used the TV with the normal SD dish connection, the performance looks good. But when i have updated the dish connection to HD, i can able to see the full quality of the product when seeing the Discovery HD, National Geographic HD etc, this is an amazing TV which comes in a lower cost, but the only minor con is that the volume of the TV is bit low when we connect to a USB's, even that scenario is occurs only for some movies not for all. But in the end its a best TV to go for it and try with the philips sound bar.. 	5 stars	  18 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  This product is Excellent.I am happy to user this product. i got 3 years of warrenty. picture clarity is very very nice. 	4 stars	  18 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  This is the most awesome Tv as compare to others, also its too economic in price. 3 Yrs warranty is added advantage but it comes with 1 year warranty and you have to registered your product on Poweroftwo.in website for another 2 yrs warranty. Flipkart customer service will help you in any step.   Some of the reviewers mentioned here that it has low sound, but i want to say sound is good and i asked philips technician and he said don't merge your remote controls with your D2H device otherwise you will get low sound from TV.   Picture Quality is too good. On the first day itself, i tested it by attaching with My MacbookPro Laptop and PC. I played 3D movie and HD movie also from My PC. and its working fine with Quality picture. HD channels are too Good to view on this. 3D movies looks and feels realistic. If some of you don't know how to Play 3D movies. then just get a 3D movie and play it on laptop using KM player. just Click on 3D button on Player and it will show 3D picture. but for that you have to wear 3D glasses.   If you want to do more with your TV, you can buy Google Chromecast. Its a Pendrive like device by which you can control your Tv with your Smart Phone. you can play Youtube or can browse anything online. But it needed your wifi connection for that. Enjoy !!!  One month passed and its working fine by now. Let's see.   	5 stars	  18 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  Received the TV within 2 day of ordering, and just another day more to get it installed. Awesome service as promised by flipkart. Happy about it.   Coming back to the TV,  1. The design and aesthetics is simply awesome. Probably this being a very latest model (Released in September/October 2014), the looks and design impresses way beyond any other tv in this range.  2. Picture quality is simply superb, While the HD channels have got a different dimension of clarity, the SD channels have got a finer touch as well (Pardon, if I am being too biased, but this being a personal opinion as compared to my previous LCD tv and other tvs I have tried out). Haven't quite tried out Samsung/Sony Latest products, so won't comment on the comparable quality of this. 3. A lot of reviews have spoken a bit negative on the sound, but I feel okay with it. Yes, it hasn't quite got superb bass/treble, but c'mmon if that is the audio quality we expect, we can always go for a home theatre, lets not be harsh on the TV for this. 4. 3 Years Warranty is an added advantage for this TV 5. The TV has got quite good response time and hardly lags in detection and mode switches  Well, what else do we require from a TV? 40 inches LED TV from the Brand of Philips, with a 3 Years warranty , I am quite happy about it and would definitely recommend 	5 stars	  13 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  Great product!!! Using it for more than a month now. Have no complaints... Only drawback is that all the ports (USB, HDMI, etc. is located at a very inconvenient location (for that I am using extension chords). Before buying I had some doubt about sound quality based on few customer reviews. I want to assure you that it is not a concern at all. 	5 stars	  10 Mar 2015

flipkart.com	  purchased tv on February 20.Order ID: OD102125117172917300. Delivery and installation was fast. Thanks to flipkart. TV is very sleek and display is very good. Played few HD videos through pen drive. Clarity is better than many TV's at this range. Only negative point is the sound. Have purchased Philips MMS4040F 2.1 Multimedia Speakers. Suits well with this TV.    Worst part is that there is no remote provided with the TV unit. TV is already installed. Currently I am managing with the buttons on the TV to select modes and airtel DTH. Contacted flipkart customer care, they asked me to purchase remote from outside. They promised that this amount will be refunded. checked with 4 Philips stores near my home. Unfortunately none has remote for this TV. Spoke with Philips customer care on 22nd February. They informed that they will send an engineer with this remote in 24 hours.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Update on 5 march 2015    Philips cutomer care finally sent an engineer with remote. They charged rs 1050/- for new remote. Flipkart has already refunded 600/- to my wallet account. Waiting for remaining amount from them.  Even though faced few issues earlier, but finally everything is fine. Looking forward to make more purchases from flipkart because of their excellent service :) 	5 stars	  02 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  I got my tv in excellent condition,Thanks to flipkart for their fast and safe service. Flipkart Team Coordinated very well from purchase to delivery and installation of the product. But not happy with the installation service provided by philips .Installation was done after ten days. I recommend to purchase from "WS Retail" seller. Delivery of product in 3 days/ Brand new Product/Good Packaging/100% Satisfaction about the product sold by WS Retail.  About LED TV,I am writing this review after 45 days of purchase. Picture quality is very good.Sound is also good for a small room (20*12). for Good HD Experience,Must buy product (Cheap and Best).  	5 stars	  01 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  Dear All, I bought this TV from Flipkart. But the Picture Quality is very bad. I made the complaint at the time of installation only but Flipkart insisting me to wait for Philips engineer visit which is already done & the engineer also claimed it has picture quality issue but I am still waiting for my money. FLIPKART this is really sad you are not doing enough. This is almost 10 days now I am still waiting for action. 	1 star	  27 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  I booked the TV on 17th Feb and the TV was delivered on 19th Feb. The overall experience of buying from FK was awesome. The Philips service person came within 2 days and installed it. I have connected it to Videocon D2H SD. the Picture quality if amazing. The looks of the TV is also great. Guests at my house were amazed at the how thin the TV is. Unlike of some reviews mentioned here, the Sound quality is good. I ahve added external speakers for better bass sound. But overall, i am very satisfied with the TV. Only 1 issue i have with Philips, for getting 3 years warranty, i had registered on the site www.poweroftwo.com but even after 5 days, i have not received confirmation mail that 3 years warranty applied. I am anyways chasing Philips on this. 	4 stars	  26 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  VERY VERY GOOD LED TV. SERVICE OF FILPKART & PHILIPS ARE TOO GOOD. I AM SATISFY WITH BOTH SERVICE & PRODUCT. 	5 stars	  26 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  TV is best in this price range. The picture clarity is awesome. Colour display is rich although I had a minute observation that people faces were having a slight yellowish tinge especially under shadows or indoors. Outdoor colours were absolutely fine. I visited the electronics store and saw that this yellowish tinge was evident in all TV brands.  The volume is loud enough for a 14 by 11 room. There is no bass. It has all basic features for a smart TV which is mentioned in specifications. No WiFi. 	5 stars	  26 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Flip kart delivery is awesome fast. Good installation and demo. Pros- Good picture quality with SD set-top box. Cheap Cons:- 1) No 3.5mm Jack for headphone. 2) Only 1 USB 3) Remote control is very basic 4) Sound is ok 	4 stars	  24 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Hello,  I have bought the 50 inch variant of 5059 series from a dealer . Picture quality and everything is fantastic.  A user here has reported that there is some connectivity issue with PC over HDMI. But I can now confirm that my setup is working properly and sound is also coming through HDMI only . I have 5850 ATI GPU and everything is working fine.   Please re-check your connections once more.  Thanks 	5 stars	  22 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Good Value for Money, Very good picture & sound quality, Slim design, Backed with3 years warranty which is the best in comparison. 	4 stars	  20 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Been using this product for 1 month. It offers excellent picture quality. I used it with SD DTH connection and still it was a good experience from 7-8 feet away while watching cricket . Upgraded to HD and now it is awesome.  Sound is flat. It is very feeble from USB source. But a good 2.1 should address this. The only other cone I found was the position of ports. It is almost impossible to reach after wall mounting the tv. 	5 stars	  20 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Pros: (1) Too good for the price point,  (2) Excellent picture quality. (3) Motion rate is at its best  Cons: (1) Sound quality when source is AIRTEL HD is not that great, but the same sound quality when playing movies , songs from the USB is at its best (comparable to the Sony Bravia which i had earlier)  (2) AIRTEL HD TV guys did a REMOTE pairing. over last few weeks i am noticing the issue of when i switch off, TV starts automatically switched on. This is not happening always. This happens very few times in a week. Not sure whether beacuse of TV remote or beacuse of pairing or anything else. 	4 stars	  20 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Very happy and satisfied with this product. Flipkart delivery was awesome and installation from Philips team also happened same day. The TV is good. Sound & Video is nice. 	5 stars	  13 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Bought this TV on 10Feb 9pm and was received by 12Feb 11am. So hats off to Flipkart for such a quick delivery. This is even better than purchasing in the store where one has to chase up the dealer for delivery. The product was delivered on time and the delivery guys unpacked the product for me to inspect. They showed the various things that come in the box. Inquired whether I would require installation assistance or not.  Coming to the product, it's an excellent VFM product in this price range. I've been using a Sony 32 TV before and in contrast I find this product so much better.  Pros: 1. 40" LED TV at a very decent price. Brand = Philips. I bought this on HDFC EMI so I got 2500/- less. Didn't have an old TV to exchange, else it could have been even cheaper 2. Connectivity options are very good - 1 USB, 2 HDMI (one for DTH and one for DVD player), AV in, YBR in, and direct connection with anteena. Outputs are AV out. 3. Sound is good. As many people have complained, it's not so. The sound is loud enough for normal TV watching experience. Don't expect huge bass as this is a slim LED TV. Can always connect 2.1 or higher configuration speakers. 4. Picture quality is very good. Please note that you need to test with a good source of input like HD DTH or DVD or Blueray. Normal DTH or cable won't show crisp picture 5. Configuration options are good. Usual options available in most TV  Cons: 1. Menu is slightly slow. Sometimes navigation doesn't work fast. But it is not a big deal as we don't need to use TV remote often  That's all for now. Will update this review as I continue to use the TV. Overall, a great experience. I would highly recommend this product. It is future proof and comes at a very good price range. Just go for it.  Edit: The engineer from Philips visited my place and checked installation (I had done it myself before he came). He asked for any problems I may be facing - I mentioned about the remote control. He said that it will ease up in few days after using. Now, after some days, the remote control did ease up and is functioning much better than before. 	5 stars	  13 Feb 2015

flipkart.com	  Value for Money. Experience was more than expected. Connecting my existing Philips Stereo with this was an additional add-on that was never thought off and has provided a great home-theater experience.   - Movies from CD/DVD worked correctly - Movies from USB/Hard Disk worked efficiently as against other negative reviews i had   seen from other buyers on this product - Great home-theater experience with additional speakers attached from my Philips   Audio System  Delivery & Installation was facilitated by Flipkart & Philips on the same day that doubled my enjoyment of the purchase. 	5 stars	  09 Feb 2015

flipkart.com	  Bought this television a month ago and i just want to share that it is a best thing you can get at this price. Picture quality is as good as LG or Sony with less 10k price.Design is superb and service is great as long as Philips is involved. Sound is little flat but any set top box makes it fine.  Buy it without hesitation !! 	5 stars	  07 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Top notch delivery by Flipkart in one day as promised. The Philips technician was at my doorstep one hour post delivery. That is exceptional.   Only disadvantage is of a lack of 3.5mm audio out. Need to get the converter. 	5 stars	  06 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  I placed an order for this huge LED FHD on 13 jan 15 for Rs.29990/- and they delivered it on 17 jan 15 before expected delivery time. before purchasing 40" LED i surveyed almost every where in shop i was planning to buy samsung, sony or LG but i visited one shop where i saw philips PFL5059 40" just beside sony and i shocked to see that philips was looking outstanding in clarity even far better than samsung LG and if u hide the logo of the LED you cant recognize which one is sony, samsung. but one thing is there speaker volume is low as compare to other but you can fix this by using 5.1 speakers. And after that i decided to buy this Beast without any doubt. Order placed and the flipkart had shown the fabulous response unbelievable, the packing of LED was just mind blowing, I took almost 15 min to unbox my LED. Function of LED is pretty decent and basic and its ok coz most of us using DTH now a days. It detects 1 TB HDD in no time and it plays almost every format. The design is very attractive and it look good in both table top and wall mount. I am very much happy to buy this beautiful LED. strongly recommend plz dont waste your money in buying costly LED. 	5 stars	  05 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Picture quality is amazing, I have been using for 2 months now with Videocon d2h HD. Excellent clarity, My daughter watches rhymes copied on USB, too good for that also, Sound quality is also very good, I have been using philips 5.1 Speakers with TV before, I have packed it for now. Need to check adding it later. 	5 stars	  05 Feb 2015

Dont go for expensive brand as so called SMART features are good only for boasting pone hardly uses it.  	5 stars	  03 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  I really loved this product, great bargain at 27k (after exchange). As few reviews suggested, the only annoying thing about it is, occasionally stripes appear on TV, especially when the picture blue, may be it is because of the IPS display. But, a non-issue for other colors, so happy about it. 	4 stars	  02 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  the product delivered on the 27th Jan 15 as per promise. Installation done by philips person on 29th Jan 15. product was very good and getting such a amazing product at such amazing price only flipkart made it possible. Hats off. Got it for 27k only. 	5 stars	  02 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  This is value for money with all features working pretty well. Only real drawback I would say is that the ports (HDMI, VGA, USB etc) are tough to access when wall mounted. So having extenders for the USB, and HDMI would be a good idea. 	4 stars	  01 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  40inch TV with basic features. I am happy with the picture performance, Sound is bad, i brought a home theater to offset sound, which anyway i was planning to buy. Pic Clarity is good. USB Functionality is tricky, There is some limit on number of files it will display. So i have a 2 TB HDD with lot of movies, it couldnt show all the movies. Tested with 16GB pendrive too, so it will limit the file display to certain number. Ports are easily accessible. Best part if TV is light weight. Remote is buggy, hard time using remote. It has resume functionality while USB Playback, which is nice. No 3.5mm Jack. Interface is cool and easy to use.  Overall, Value for Money and great picture clarity at decent price.  	4 stars	  28 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  not the best, but better that other market giants, really great picture quality,   but there is only 12 months instead of 36 months warranty certificate provided in the box.  #flipkart solve this issue.  no 3.5mm jack, 	4 stars	  24 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  Although manufactured by Videocon owned agency and marketed by Philips, this TV is no less compared to its expensive counterparts. I have a 32" Sony as well and the picture quality in the Phillips set is no less than the Sony. Audio is an issue, but install a pair of good speakers and your problem is solved! Perfect choice for a sub 30K (Rs) LED. Also, the 3 years warranty is a big comfort factor.  Flipkart delivery and Phillips installation, both were highly commendable, in terms of timeliness and professionalism. 	5 stars	  19 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  I ordered this LED after doing much research. Also visited the local shops in Pune. But this model was not available with them. For 4000 series they were quoting upto 37000 Rs.I don't understand why such big price difference in online and shop purchases.  Any way I am really happy that flipkart delivered me this awesome television as promised. Very good packaging as usual. Got 3390 Rs off as purchased from flipkart app.  Also got 3 years extended warranty.  Viewing experience is just awesome. No problem at all.  I love PHILIPS brand and flipkart too. 	5 stars	  15 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  This is the product which will satisfy the basic needs of having 40inch HD TV. Picture quality is really good with HD set top box.

flipkart.com	  Awesome picture quality with HD DTH. Full HD Screen is good, volume a bit on lower side, detects external drives very fast & plays almost all formats. I think TV manufacturers should change the placement of ports as it is very difficult to connect any wires if you have wall mounted the TV. Excellent Service from Flipkart team. Thank you so much to Philips and Flipkart  	4 stars	  13 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  Very Good LED and value for money with 3 year extended warranty. Most of the features are there at this price point except two - No IPS Display, hence diagonal visibility is poor. And audio is a bit inferior. Gives much better results under DTH against Cable. 	5 stars	  31 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Its been 3 weeks now, i am quite happy with the TV performance and screen size. Its amazing, and viewing angle is really good. Sound quality is good too, you just need to vary the incredible sound setting ON / OFF to vary the sound / audio quality.   And most important thing is the service from Philips. I have installed this TV 100 KMs away from Bangalore, and its installed by Philips technician within 2 days of delivery. 	5 stars	  31 Dec 2014

Now I directly connected my CPU via hdmi with this TV. I watch full HD 1080p youtube videos and feeling good. I have connected Creative 2.1 speakers with my CPU and not on TV. (Because the TV's sound is poor when we connect USBs) 	5 stars	  29 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  The TV was delivered promptly as per the delivery date and time. The installation was also done the very next day by Philips. So thumbs up to Flipakrt and Philips service.  After some tweaking of picture settings, I have managed to get the image to more natural and realistic levels whereas form factory they where too vivid n bright.  The only issue I am facing with the picture quality is over pronounced red n shades of red, which I am unable to tone down.  I wish it had more picutre tuning options, it just has the most basic options which even my previous 5 yr old LCD had.  Essentially for 30k you are getting a no nonsense no frills basic direct lit led TV. If you are OK with it then go for it.  At least it has the known Philips Precise pixel processing engine which has to be much more superiors to any other TVs in this price brackets like micromax or sansui or videocon, VU etc which have unknown and some random processing engines.   Yes, the sound volume is OK for a small room but its quite hollow and tiny sounding.   One major issue I faced, the remote control was not working, essentially its dead on arrival. I have already lodged in a complaint with philips and promptly got a calk back from one of the local Philips service center rep that it will be replaced in 2 days.  So all in all, a Great vfm, no frill, nonsense buy. For average consumer the picture quality after some tweaking would be great only the videophiles might find it inadequate.  But obviously a much better buy the other cheap brands I have mentioned. 	4 stars	  27 Dec 2014

Was shocked.Then started researching on things.Went to showroom to see the performance of this model.But this 5000 series model was not available in any of the showrooms but analyzed 4000 series.It was performing good.Compared other models but for this range only 32 inches are available in other brands like LG,Samsung,Sony.So finally came to a conclusion for booking this TV.Booked on 7th Dec in Citibank credit card in 12 EMI.The interest amount as an offer was returned back to my Flipkart wallet(for which you can purchase things in flipkart but only from WS retail).I had blocked a time slot on 11th due to my non-availabilty.Flipkart is fabulous in delivery.By 10am flipkart courier service ringed me on 11th and they delivered the tv and took old CRT.I just ringed up philips immediately and by evening they had sent their persons for installing.Mounting bracket is provided in the box.By 5pm total installation is over.Sound quality and picture quality is good.Value for money.So thin,not like other philips model.So Sexy and attractive.Only thing when movies are played via USB the sound is very low.I had connected my creative 2.1 and now it suits my living room aptly.Also when wall mounted it is very difficult to insert USB.So i bought a USB extension cable for Rs110 at nearby shop and now the issue is resolved.For 30,040/- its woth for money that too 40inch... Go for it!!! 	5 stars	  21 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart makes sure that purchasing TV online at their site is an experience better than an in store purchase. In 4 days of placing the order, the TV was delivered & installed.   Looks great, the picture quality is great, especially when viewed from front (Slight color variation when viewed from sides - this is common for all non IPS panels). Viewing angles are great, even though this is not an IPS panel. USB plays most video formats, has multiple connectivity options and is easy to operate. Sound is sufficiently loud, never have to turn up the volume over 30. Satisfied with purchase as its great value for money. You must have a HD settop box and channels to really make justice to its picture quality.  some downsides...TV does not come with any cables, so had to spend a couple of hundred on new cables. The USB port at back is a little hard to access if the TV is wall mounted, so you might want to buy a USB extender cable so you ca easily attach USB devices, without having to remove the TV from wall mount.  I had compared this TV to samsung, LG & Sony brands, all of which cost about 7K to 10K more. And the plasma from LG and Samsung around this price, although are good products , but lack HD experience and lively colors of LED. This is simply the best branded Full HD TV once can but in its price range. 	5 stars	  21 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Thanks to flipkart delivered in time. If you want to say about the television its superb. I bought this television on 18 December 2014. I used to buy only sony and samsung product in electronics. This is the first time i have bought philips product (TV). I never expected the equality from philips. No need to buy samsung or sony bcoz its very similar to those products. Display looks awesome. I suggest everyone to buy this product. Its worth for money. No need to waste your money of buying other brands like samsung or sony. 	5 stars	  18 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart, is always at its best when delivery of good comes in picture. Superbly packed material.  13th Dec I ordered this product at night and received on 16th Dec afternoon, which is prior to 6 days of delivery commitment. Along with got it installed by Philips on 17th Dec.  Product seems to be nice by it shape and size. Still i need to explore the options provided. So cannot comment on this. But for this beauty I went ahead after reading all the reviews under 30K budget. I got this product in 28,040 Rs under exchange scheme during GOSF event. 	5 stars	  18 Dec 2014

flipkart.com	  I ordered this LED after doing much research. Also visited the local shops in Pune. But this model was not available with them. For 4000 series they were quoting upto 37000 Rs.I don't understand why such big price difference in online and shop purchases.  Any way I am really happy that flipkart delivered me this awesome television as promised. Very good packaging as usual. Got 3390 Rs off as purchased from flipkart app.  Also got 3 years extended warranty.  Viewing experience is just awesome. No problem at all.  I love PHILIPS brand and flipkart too. 	5 stars	  17 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  I dont want to spend 10-15 K extra just for the smart TV option. because in india ,we don't get the band width which supports smart TV features to the fullest.   I would buy cromecast and use it to convert my TV to smart :) 	4 stars	  16 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Thanks Flipkart for fast delivery & Philips for quick installation within 4 hrs of delivery. About product,Picture quality is pretty good compared to leading brand Tvs in this price braket. I am just little disappointed by sound quality.....but that can be ignored.....just buy it...go for it 	5 stars	  12 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Got the product within a day  About product Best in the range i have searched many sites and read many reviews before buying this and i am happy with product that i got. Best part is that Philips giving 3year warranty for the product and Flipkart made claiming the warranty easier. 	5 stars	  12 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Spot on Delivery at time mentioned while ordering & was amazed to see the quick  delivery to even city like Jaipur. The product was good & had all components as mentioned. Flipkart itself coordinated for installation & hence no hussle at my side and was done on same day at delivery   I just mentioned above line to compare it with other services, where i ordered the same product but did not got anything till a month and then i had to cancel the same, and i ordered again and got defective piece which even had a wall mount stand missing.  Hence you can see the difference and my experience with both firms in same product.  Thanks Flipkart. 	4 stars	  11 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Excellent clarity and clarity of sound suitable for a decent size living room. Aesthetic wise, best in its class with thinnest bezel. Make sure you have HD connection from the subscriber. Low power consumption is another nice feature which is a low burden on the electricity bill. 	5 stars	  02 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  I got this TV this Diwali. Nice Product  Pros: 1. Good Picture Qualty (if watching MKV movies) 2. Decent size  Cons: 1. Sound is bit less.. 2. Less Video Format supported  All Together this is a decent buy, in its range 	4 stars	  01 Dec 2014

flipkart.com	  As per promise , Flipkart delivered it on time. 5 star for that.   For installation and Demo I will give "minus" "-5 star" It took more than 13 days for flipkart to assign installation and demo for me.  But I did it myself by directly contacting to Philips customer care in 4 days.  I bought it for 26k with special discount offer and SBI 10% off. :D  "Super value for money product."  No sound issue at all Thin display looks sexy :D Zakkas video. Stand makes it more gorgeous.  No issue at all till date.  Loved the product.  Thank you flipkart. 	5 stars	  30 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Flipkart is usually known and famous for its on time deliveries but in this case I haven't seen such a pathetic response on the delivery. I had specifically asked the customer care executive and she confirmed that the item would be delivered in next 2 days but its been 4 days now but there is no information on the product availability. The team is following up with the back end team. Come on, if you can't deliver don't make promises. The product was supposed to be presented as a gift to someone but due to all this non-sense I had to rush late evening in the market to order another one from Market. 	1 star	  29 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  I would like to thank Flipkart and Ekart(whom nobody thanks anyways) for the prompt and service standards almost bordering on concierge quality..... Thank you very much.  Product is very good considering its price.. Would recommend it. Only advice is to buy a sound system along with it as the speakers are puny and audio quality is bad.   	4 stars	  23 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Yesterday, I ordered 3 Led TVs (Philips 40PFL5059). I got order confirmation but within a minute it got cancelled and my Rs 91773 got stuck upto dec 1, 2014. I called customer care but they told that they will not be able to help in this matter. They told me try to order fresh only single TV at a time, it may work. Second time also i got order confirmation for 1 led tv for Rs 30591 but within a minute it got cancelled. I again called flipkart's CC, they told that money will be return within 8-10 days. I was gifting these tv to my father. I was taking these tv to bihar as there is no delivery there. Now, I can't as my money got stuck for a week atleast and i have my train on this saturday. I have been active online customer and my views about flipkart was different till last night. Now, I have very different opinion and worst online experience. If, I will not be able to gift these TV to my father in this trip, I will make sure my circle never purchase any product from this sick online megastore. And what a sick Customer care which says we understand your problem. I am very very disappointed and angry at this sick site which said your Rs 122000 got stuck for 10 days due to technical issue. Zero rating was not an option. Hahahahaha, again a sick way to get atleast 1 star in a review. 	1 star	  22 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Bought this and as everyone says, great service by Flipkart and installation was done as promised the next day of the delivery and yes the TV gives a great experience for the money you pay.  Tested this this TV end to end by connecting it to a Airtel HD set top box and also connecting it to a PC through the 2 HDMI Slots provided and the PC video processing using the AMD 6800 Graphic Card.  The experience you get using the TV is decent, the picture quality is good overall but is inconsistent across different HD videos played on Youtube and oddly enough even on the set top box the HD channels delivered inconsistent picture quality. Some videos/ Channels were exceptionally good but some of the other were a little ordinary. From a gaming perspective, this is one TV you should seriously consider, the refresh rate is great and the the LED is bright. Excellent experience while playing Call of duty Modern Warfare. The sound through the TV is absolutely not good. In short the speakers sound like a mobile phone loud speaker which has been amplified. Experienced a lot of echo even though i went for the wall mount set up as recommended by Philips since the speakers on the back.  Some videos will make you question the price of the TV as well as to how it is being sold for 32990 after the savings on Flipkart.  And the most important point, I bought this TV looking at the 3 Year warranty and guess what, the TV user manual and the warranty card states that it is a 12 month warranty which i think is false advertisement on Flipkart's part. Also, there is no proper way of registering for warranty on Philips site as all they ask you for is to upload the invoice of the bill.  This has been a mixed experience overall but still a good buy as my motive was gaming and this TV is excellent for the same. 	4 stars	  18 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  I have ordered this product on 21st October 2014.  1.Flipkart Delivery-They have promised to deliver the product on 28 October from 10AM-12PM(received an SMS) .I have taken a day off and I was waiting for the product to be delivered.The delivery person has called around 1 PM for delivery but till 9.30PM no one has come.My complete day has gone waste. Finally it has been delivered on 29th.  2.Installation is done after 4 fine days.  3.My Invoice copy-The S.No of my TV is not matching with the S.No printed on the Invoice.I have called the customer care,they said I have to send the snaps of the S.No details on the TV and the invoice in an e-mail to the concerned team.I have done the same very promptly but no reply from them yet. I have called the customer care n-number of times but they say within 24 hrs I will be getting a reply.But there are so many 24 hrs gone,but not even a single reply from them.  4.Next on the TV-I have reported the USB issue and the remote control not functioning issues and raised a return request. But for that also it was committed that by 5th Nov I would be getting a call.But no calls. After that I have called Flipkart almost every day.But they said the same answer 24 hrs. I have received a SMS saying that it will be resolved by 11nov,but no reply. Again I have received another SMS saying that it be resolved by 13 Nov,but no response at all. I have a called the cust.care on 14th Nov,they said that within 24 hrs it will be resolved. But till today(17/11) not even a single call from Flipkart.  Still not even a single thing mentioned above is rectified.   I was looking for a (minus 5 stars) but I was not able to get that. 	1 star	  17 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Got the product on 13/11/2014 and the installation was completed on 14/11/2014. Flipkart is Amazing kudos !!!! The Philips executive was really friendly and forthcoming which made me appreciate the service they offer. Now with regard to the TV. It is a delight to watch. The bezels are razor thin and this device is a thing of beauty and statement of style. The stand looks good to top it off. Now coming to the features it is a base TV no gimmicky smart features or 3D which is a pure waste of money since it slows down refresh rates and provides features which quite frankly aren't useful in day to day life. The display is brilliant, though a bit on the reflective side so dont keep it against direct sunlight. The resolution of Full HD is a delight to watch, 240 HZ refresh rate only makes things better as no other TV offers it and its great for sports and gaming (I personally use ps3). The sound is good enough to fill a decent sized room (better than most brands). And philips warranty of 3 years is an icing on the cake.  Note :- Here is just an advice, don't buy TV's from reputed brands since the difference in the price is what they charge for advertising. This TV is equal to if not better than the rest. Also, SD quality videos look pixalated (Better prefer a HD setup Box beleive me its worth it !!). For HD videos or streaming there is nothing better !! 	5 stars	  17 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  please put it into under 3 offers as you are offering on other LED TVS of Philips Brand, i want to buy it but only if you can put it under Exchnage offer 	4 stars	  15 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  I would like to thank Flipkart for bringing this wonderful 40" Philips LED TV to my home at such an affordable price. I researched many other brands and found that Philips provided the best value for money. The picture clarity is excellent. The TV looks very good and is very slim. The sound quality is good with Cable TV however it requires speakers / home theatre system when watching movies from a usb or dvd player. I have purchased F&D 5.1 channel speakers which makes the whole movie watching experience excellent. The Flipkart representatives delivered the product very promptly and efficiently at the predetermined time on 10/11/2014. The Philips representative set up the TV within two hours of me receiving the TV. On the whole I am very impressed with both Flipkart and Philips and can truly say that I am a delighted and satisfied customer. 	4 stars	  15 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Philips TV is a good buy in this price range, for specially who're looking only for Full HD and not concerned about Smart TV features.  Flipkart and Philips were very prompt in delivering and installing it.  Picture quality, Sound quality and all other TV features are simply the best. 	5 stars	  08 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Unfortunately received faulty TV set with volume issue which both philips & flipkart readily acknowledged & replaced.  After comparison found that between 4000 series TV & 5000 series TV only difference is that of power consumption 100 watts & 70 Watts respectively. All features are identical. Flipkart delivered the product on time & collected old tv as well for exchange.   Full HD Screen is good, volume a bit on lower side, detects external drives very fast & plays almost all formats. I think TV manufacturers should change the placement of ports as it is very difficult to connect any wires if you have wall mounted the TV.  Definitely VFM product 	4 stars	  07 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  I ordered the LED TV on 2nd November and as promised got delivered on 3rd November,2014. at 1500 Hrs. I called up flipkart to know when the installation will be done, they responded that the same will be done in next 24-48 hours, but we didnt receive any message /communication for delay etc. Hence I advice them to take it back.  Seriously Flipkart is only efficient in Mumbai region and very poor in KOLKATA. There service sucks.  	1 star	  06 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  I did my review on MMX Led TV with various display size and I finally found this as the best fit for me. I was using Sony 40" for more than 4 years, and with the same experience I reviewed this product and here is my review.  Is it Worth? Yes! Definitely. The LED panel life time of almost all mmx TV is 30000 hrs. (Sony TV has 100000 hrs for the LCD). For a 31k budget, you cannot expect much more than this. I would be happy if this TV works for minimum 3 years at least (as it guarantees 3.5 years). People with more money, never mind about this. My review is not for them ;)  Picture Quality: I've read somewhere saying the Contrast level for MMX 40" LED is not so good. Yes, it's true with 40", but this 50" TV has no such problem. In fact, I reduced the contrast level to 12 from 60 right after the installation because it's having enough contrast to pain your eyes.  Sound Quality: You cannot expect a JBL woofer inside 1.5 inch thickness TV. I have connected my TV with my PC, USB, Airtel Digital TV and Analog Cable TV and with those all, I have never used more than 15 level (out of 100) for Sound. Isn't good enough? I don't find any problem in the sound. Gladly, it also supports an external Audio Out for 2.1 Audio System.   Physical Appearance: Front looking is good. The plastic border around the TV is small which gives more space for the display and occupies less space. Also it's good the logo is too small and almost not visible on the TV. The remote sensor at the bottom looks bit odd, but I understand there is no other place to keep it.  Accessories: I am sure, you will like it. Some one mentioned, the remote plastic is not good. I am sure, the remote is good and plastic is fine. The look and feel of the remote is good too.  Do not look at the wall mounts, you may think its not strong enough to hold the TV for a longer time, but it can hold it because the TV weight is considerably low. I can move the TV alone. So, it's fine too.  Graphics: The menu and other layouts graphics are very bad and you will feel like you are playing some "Made in Chine" type external video player. But it's doesn't mean to anyone if they are going to DTH.  Connectivities: 2 HDMI, 2 USD and 1 VGA should be sufficient enough, at least till 2018. Also I am not sure you can use a Google Chrome device as it requires the USB nearby HDMI. Still I guess you can use a USB extension cable.  What I feel that could have been improved as they are not gonna cost a lot for MMX. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1/ Physical buttons on the TV is not easily accessible.   2/ The HDMI points at the bottom is little difficult to use. Connect once and forget it, if you wanna keep change them, you should have more patience.  3/ BUILD QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. MMX don't need give a high quality plastic and finishing at this cost, but at least, they should have fixed the parts and everything decently. For instance, if you touch the LED panel at the corners, you can feel it's not fit with all around the border.  4/ Psychologically most of the people will have a thought, that it might go mad at anytime because it's cheap. For those people, please hope for the best. I have asked my friends who is using this TV for more than 8 months and 1 year, they are good too. So no worries.  PS: I will keep updating this review as long as I use this.  Oops! I forgot to review about Flipkart. Yeah, it's quite boring because I have to write the same thing every time. The delivery was good and they carried the TV inside the hall and handled it so softly. The installation happened exactly in 48 hours. The voice support guy was so amazing to explain me by saying "Sir, please do not open the box until our service men come and do the installation". ;).   So please keep the box unopened until the installation guy knock your door.   	5 stars	  24 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  I did a lot of research over the net to get the best price for this product and I got this product at its best price. i.e 31540. This includes SBI Cash Back of Rs 1250 and Rs 1200 for exchanging my 15 inch not working TV.  I ordered this TV on 21-Oct-2014 and got the product delivered on 26-Oct-2014. Before the product comes I had already ordered for Tata Sky HD+ and it was a pleasure to watch HD channels on the TV. My whole family is satisfied with the choice I made to go for Micromax.   I could not see a mere pixel from a distant level. The colors were so bright that I could see every single and small detail of the picture.  If you are ordering this TV then I would recommend that you get Tata Sky HD installed. "Kasam se HD dekhne ka mazaa aa jayega".  I think Micromax is on the verge of redefining its brand image in Indian markets.  Amendment on 27-Nov-2014:   What I wrote 1 month back after using the TV for 2 days is absolutely true even now after using the TV after 1 month.  There is not even a single drawback which I could see in this TV.  I have started watching Hollywood movies after a gap of nearly 10 years because of the superb picture quality and my Tata Sky HD Recording Box. I am loving watching Hollywood movies (Only on Tata Sky HD channels).  Blindly go for it people. 	5 stars	  27 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  There is no audio output, which means this TV cannot be connected to a home theater. While today, even primitive TV models have a basic function of audio out, Micromax, I donot understand how could they make such a blunder.

flipkart.com	  My review of Micromax 50C1200FHD 124 cm (49) LED TV is as follows, 1. Picture Quality - Decent but not on par with LG/Samsung/Panasonic  2. Sound Quality- 10W*2 speakers just about does the job, SRS surround feature does not do any justice in enhancing the sound but further worsens the experience  3. Build Quality: Very Good for the cost on offer (you wont have the sheer WOW experience of Samsung or LG or a Sony)  4. 2 USB ports available (for the people who are curious to know, yes it plays most of the video formats if not all)  5. Interfaces for AVI/Component/HDMI are awkwardly placed and are difficult to access   6. TV was shipped with beautiful chrome table mounts, wall mount accessories, remote control with 2 AAA batteries (pls use the batteries from Duracell/Eveready, these tend to leak after some time spoiling the remote) warranty card and a user Manual.  7. User interface could have been better or may be i am too very used to the simple interface of the LG 42" LCD i currently own.  8. HD content reproduction is not on par with the LED TV's of premium make, but just about does the job.   Overall pretty satisfied with the make and its definitely a value for money proposition, At 32K change its a bargain... 	4 stars	  31 Oct 2014

flipkart.com	  This TV is awesome.  Picture quality is equivalent to any existing brands, watched HD movies WALL-E, How to  train your dragon, Kung Fu Panda, The quality is mind blowing.  I found the rich colors some better then my old Samsung LED TV.  Connected my local cable and watched some regional channels, the quality is better then my old Samsung TV.   I am fan of rich and vivid colors, being a photographer would like to see pics and videos on large screen, this TV is very impressive in this regards as well.   Now let us come to the main point which other companies usually refer to. The refresh rate:   60 hz... This is 100 time higher then what human eye can observe,   Samsung says it has 100 hz, Panasonic 240Hz Sony 800Hz lol. . .:P  The above values are just values to make their product sell at higher price.  If you browse your computer setting the max refresh rate there is 60 Hz.. And we play games,movies etc on it..   So there is no point in comparing TVs over refresh rate any thing above 50 Hz is great.   To conclude, if u planning to buy this TV then just go for it.. Picture quality is excellent, Sound quality is also superb , you can connect external speakers if u want to. All types of input modes available. 	5 stars	  18 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  All, order_id=OD002852376500131100 Order Amt: Rs. 31990 I am certified buyer of flipkart and I want to ensure that my feedback reaches all the buyers of FLIPKART.  I have ordered for this product on Friday ( 15 Mar 2015), got the product delivered on Saturday ( 16 Mar 2015). The installation person came to my house today to get this installed. Based on the feedback and review from the previous buyer I ensured that I do not open the package. I wanted the installation person to remove the seal. When we opened the package, I was shocked to see that the product I received was indeed a used one. I can clearly see the scratches near the wall mount area of the TV. Also the packaging items had dirt on it. I have taken pictures of them but I do not see any option in this feedback form to post them. I immediately called FLIPKART to cancel the order and the return is in progress ( req no: 150517037289 / representative : 150517037289 )  Advise to Buyers: 1) Think twice before buying anything which is of high value ONLINE. I had great faith on FLIPKART and had been a loyal customer so far. But today they have breached my trust. 2) Do not open the package. Let the installation guy handled it. 3) Check the packaging. Look for scratches and dents in the product. If there are any return it. 4) If anyone has ordered already this product and waiting for installation ( or had their installation recently done ) check for all the points above. Questions to FLIPKART: 1) You advertise a product saying its genuine and brand new. But why did I receive a refurbished product. 2) How many such products have already reached the customers. Is this not a case of FRAUD. 3) I am currently exploring legal options to see if this can be pursued further. I have seen similar cases with SNAPDEAL but did not expect the same from FLIPKART. You just lost a loyal customer.  	1 star	  17 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this product on 25th of March, till now no one has come to installation, have been following up with Customer care guys and local service center from almost 3 days. Had very bad experience, have almost called customer care guys 40 to 50 times. No one has turned up yet.   Please do not buy this product, worst experience with customer canr and service guys. 	1 star	  01 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have recently got this TV and been using it for few days now,i have played HD content,music,checked still images and overall i am not satisfied but not disappointed either as for this price this is the best we can get i guess.The Built quality is good and TV looks packed with features on papers but in Reality it falls below expectations. The HD content played doesn't feel like full HD,sound is not good. I would suggest to go for a 40 inch TV in the same price and Samsung,sony,LG are better in quality. If i would have to suggest something to Micromax i would suggest them to work on quality rather than on cheap prices.  Pros : 1.Cheapest 50 inch TV 2.Good for general use like with Cable TV or STB.  Cons: 1.HD content doesn't feel like HD 2.Sound is poor 3.No HDMI port on side 	4 stars	  22 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  I was too skeptical on getting this product because of 2 things 1) price for its size and specs and mixed reviews 2) Brand is pretty new and launching in a limited stock and scale.  But at the end of the day, price makes u think a lot for getting this. So I took risk to get into a local electronics shop and they had this displayed aside LG and Samsung and believe me until i asked him about Micromax, I didn't know that this 50 inch monster was Mircromax. Not even a single straight away diff between this budget jewel and the monsterly priced Brands.. I took the gamble to go with he guts.  and now after 1 months of falling in love with this and spending more time in front of TV with family, I can tell u this.. If u want luxury @ a cheap price with LED and HD facilities, no other brand can beat MicroMax in price and the size of this beauty.  Got it delivered in 2 days and next day 09:00 AM sharp Micromax engineer was on my door steps. So professional and expertised, the installation was done in 10 mins as most of the things are self explanatory. So ppl who have budge in mind, JUST GO FOR IT.  Pros: PRICE , INDIAN BRAND, SIZE for its PRICE, 2 HDMI and 2 USBs (no other brand has this combo and I dare to be proved wrong) Amazing color rendition and sound (as many complained is not a issue @ all) was great for the videos and movies we are watching.  Cons: Well if you got the best for your price investment, I guess I wont put anything else.  Only minor cliche for me is when you shuffle between HD content (External HD) and Set Up Cable, the volume setup has to be manually adjusted which is not a big pain but could have been more easy for control.  Its so light weight for its size I believe I wont go for any other brand now for my 2nd Master bedroom TV other than this beauty....  Hope you enjoi the experience and satisfaction I had with this beauty. 	5 stars	  23 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  Hi,  I am buying TV from flipkart. Micromax 50C1200FHD 124 cm (49) LED TV (Full HD). Flipkart delivery was very punctual (3-4 business days ).  But for installation and demo taking too much time its now 5 Th day from the delivery of product but still not get installed.And in case if we call flipkart customer care every time get the same answer give us 48 hours for installation.  please don't buy micromax LED TV from flipkart as there is no time limit for installation and demo.  	1 star	  01 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Hi Buyers!  First of all i would like to mention that this review has nothing to do with the quality of the product as i have not yet received it and the rating solely is based on the DELIVERY expectations not being met! (for the Order placed on early morning 15th feb).  If you are thinking of buying this product from flipkart (read 'our so trusted WS Retail'), i would recomend you to think twice! I ordered this product at 2:30 A.M. on 15th February with an assured delivery date of 26th February, to which i was hoping that the product might get delivered by 26th as the system generated date of delivery is the the most risk forecast-ed date that is predicted with respect to the product's delivery!  Apart from this, the page with the information from the courier (GAITI) tracking number has been stuck frozen on the same status since February 19th Evening and despite SO MANY phone calls to the flipkart customer service portal, i was always assured that i need not worry and my product would be delivered before the delivery date anyhow!  Even if this is a delay from the Courier department, the flipkart officials should have taken a stern action by now and escalated the matter, but all i hear are replies in cold-blood without even a nickle's sense of responsibility with respect to a clients time and money!  This isn't my first purchase from flipkart and i have never faced such a hassle before with any products! Not even during the Big Billion Sale and i am highly disappointed with this purchase i made.  I will not trouble you all with all that is going through my mind atm, but would just like to advice you to be pre-prepared to face such hassles if you are about to order this product.  P.S. For the flipkart officials and interested review readers: I'll be cancelling my order if i don't receive the my order by 27th Feb evening and will look up for an accordingly stern action towards my time and money wasted and such an unprofessional and unethical behavior! 	1 star	  27 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  I ordered this TV on 11th Feb and got the same on 13th Feb, installation was done on 14th Feb. Thumbs up to Flipkart delivery and Installation service from Micromax. BUT on the same day I noticed that black levels of this TV are very poor. The white patches can be seen on the black background throughout the screen specially at the bottom corners. I complained about the same to Flipkart and they replaced the TV but the problem remains the same. The frustrating part is the third & fourth attempt to get the 100% defect free TV were also unsuccessful, the TVs sent on 3rd & 4th attempts were even worse. Just search for "Clouding issue with LED TV". This TV model is impacted due to this problem. The Micromax is not even doing quality check for their products and due to this customers are getting impacted.   Now Flipkart is asking me to return the TV and take the refund. JUST REFUND. THAT'S IT??? what about the inconvenience I faced for a month. I also bought a 40 inch Model from Micromax which is perfectly fine in terms of black levels and other features.  REFRAIN FROM BUYING THIS 50 INCH MODEL (50C5500FHD) FROM MICROMAX 	1 star	  15 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  i was eyeing on buying huge led Tv from long time. I didnt want to invest too much on it also. I stumbled upon this product during Diwali .. But the time I place the order it was sold out. again after a week it was sold out in no time.I waited for another week to make an orderand the timing was just perfect for me. Since I am Flipkart subscriber I got additional deal off 10% on that day with exchanging my 22 inch lcd I got a steal deal of 25 k for this tv.. delivery was done in 1 day installation was done in another day.. All went smooth.kudos to flipkart team (y)  Now about tv Pros 1. Made in India :) 2. Quality is good 3. Setup is easy (easier than my previous lcd) 4. Plug in chromecast and it will be your smart TV (tried and tested) also I can share my entire mac screen  5. Installation was smooth   Cons: 1. Bit difficult to access the Hdmi,Usb ports post installation but that's ok  Thanks Micromax and Flipkart for this gem of product..  	5 stars	  19 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  It is Simply... WOW. What a fantastic television at such a low cost. Hats off to Flipkart for prompt delivery before committed time just in 3 days with proper prior appointment. It is just perfect to my requirements... no 3D or internet is necessity with TVs. Size should be big & picture quality should be fantastic. It is just perfect value for money. 	5 stars	  07 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Its a value for money, once you play the blueray movies you can watch its beauty, the product is at par with the likes of Sony or Samsung LED tv, so I recommend this product who would like to go for it and in the same way I support the slogan "buy indian product be indian" 	5 stars	  29 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  First of all it's in budget TV and I really want to thanks Micromax to give this kind of product in market. I have brought this TV from Vijay Sales 2 weeks ago. I am really happy with quality of this product.  I have seen some of HD movies in resolution of 1980x720 and it just blow my mind. Colours are awesome and it was really running smooth on my external hard disk. I was just surprise because I was thinking it will be hang somewhere but it doesn't.  Quality of sound is also good because I also have LG 32 LED but it does not give me this kind of great sound.  Also there is HDMI 2 ports, were you just plug any Media Player (eg. Amkette EvoTV) and it become your smart tv in this category. So now you can plug wifi with this and watch the entire HD Movie from internet.   I have also try to watch 4k quality and it is unbelievable.   I love this product and I will suggest all must buy.   Thanks Micromax again for this TV :) 	5 stars	  29 Oct 2014

flipkart.com	  About Flipkart - 5* - No problems, The same quick, efficient, smooth and by now boringly predictable service.  First Impressions of the TV Had read most of the reviews and knew the pros and cons from their perspective. Here's my take: Ordered a Samsung 22" and a Micromax 49". both Full HD  Overall Quality of product: Yes the remote does seem a little plasticky and the material does not feel as good as the Samsung. Not a deal breaker for me  Picture Quality: Hard to tell the difference when watching HD content. Superb picture clarity and color. SD content from my set top box just about adequate. Will upgrade to a HD box.  Sound: Many had reported low sound out put. I have a minimum 14 ft. viewing distance and maximum of 18 ft. the sound was more the adequate for me. the STB volume was at 50% and the TV volume was set to less than 20 and I had no problems whatsoever.  OSD Menu: NaaaH... it not that bad as made out to be in some reviews. Gets the job done. The Samsung was not exactly very far ahead.  Ergonomics: Yes it will be very difficult to reach for HDMI and other ports if wall mounted with the factory supplied wall mount. My solution ..got a Swivel type wall mount from out side. Now not only am I able to reach out to the ports , I can also turn the TV in any direction and will also be able to keep the walls behind the TV clean.  My take after a few hours of ownership: This is the biggest bang for your buck. 	5 stars	  26 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  It is 100% value for money..!! i dont want tv with all features and rate is above 60K or 1 Lakh and above. I want 50 inch TV with good clarity.. yes GO 4 IT >>> this TV is really perfect in clarity even in normal SD set top box and cable connection, after i used 1week of SD box i updated with Airtel HD box, u believe it or not i cannot believe my eyes i wached IPL matches in HD channel.. it is simply WOW...!!! it is a huge tv for middle class ppl at budget price,.. after i brought one of my colleague and cousin order this tv. Im fully satisfied. 	5 stars	  27 May 2015

flipkart.com	  Saw some reviews Negatively but anyways as its coming for 33 purchased it, am extremely happy with the quality of it, its almost equivalent to samsung or sony, Sound quality is also good (some say sound is not that good infact bad) but pretty much happy with the sound too. HD channels are like crystal clear in TV (i use videocon hd) Only negative i found in this tv is that i cant pull 1TB hard drives smoothly, and cant play large size movies smoothly. other than that everything is good. 	5 stars	  04 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  I purchased MicromaX TV recently from FlipKart at a much discounted price,  I bought it at Flipkart for around 32K with exchange offer  Over all TV is functioning well. You cannot expect the picture quality of a high end Sony or LG TV. But the quality is not bad either Considering the price at which it is sold, I have no complaints what so ever.  Plus, it is an Indian brand. So tax money goes to Indian government.  	5 stars	  25 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  I cant expect much from a 50' tv for 31k (under exchange). But human tendency is to expect more :) I am ruling out the price factor from by review, and evaluating it as a tv.  Pros : Good display Works  Cons : Only 2 hdmi only 1 AV  No quick plug hdmi socket on corner. UI is pretty basic Sound is low There is a sound out AV plug in corner, but the output from that too is disappointing.  Summary : A 50' tv for 33k is a steal. rest all can be compensated for using external devices. Go for it....dont expect the moon.  	4 stars	  09 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Good service by flipkart I ordered on 24th Dec-2014 and it got delivered on 25th Dec-2014 in Bangalore. My Review for this This is good product for watching movies but not for them who like high volume sound and base. If you want to enjoy movies with high volume you have to play movie in your computer and connect your computer with this and then you will able to computer connected speaker for good sound quality but not directly in this Led TV. Ports are 2-HDMI, 2-USB, 1- RF connectivity, 1-VGA for system (15 Pin D-sub), 1- AV output, 1-AV Input. There is no Head Phone output for 3.5 MM Jack and you cannot connect external speaker in this model. You can connect 500 GB HDD drive and Video file format support MP4 only none of the other format it support for video while playing movie from USB   	5 stars	  29 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  I bought this product today and it is such a Awesome TV. The picture and voice clarity is similar to SONY, SAMSUNG & LG. Absolutely fantastic TV.

flipkart.com	  Well,   Its First time I am buying Giant product - TV from flipkart. Micromax 50C1200FHD 124 cm (49) LED TV (Full HD). Flipkart delivery was very punctual (3-4 business days ).  BUT, INSTALLATION FROM PRODUCT COMPANY TAKING TOO MUCH OF DELAY....ITS 8TH DAY FROM THE ORDER NOW AND STILL I DON'T HAVE ANY UPDATE ON INSTALLATION. I ALMOST EVERYDAY APPROACH FLIPKART AND EVERYDAY I GOT ANSWER LIKE WITHIN 24-48 HOURS IT WILL GET INSTALLED.  IN FESTIVAL TIME, I AM SURE THERE IS A RUSH !!! BUT THE DELAY OF 8 DAYS IS NOT AT ALL ACCEPTABLE TO ANY CUSTOMER.  VERY POOR SERVICE.  LETS HOPE THIS FEEDBACK AT LEAST HELP FLIPKART AND MICROMAX TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMITMENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES.  Regards, Deep   	1 star	  27 Oct 2014 
flipkart.com	  My Uncle bought this tv last week and I was madly excited since it was damn cheap, only 35000 rs for a 50" Full HD LED TV. The main and most important reason to get excited was the brand Micromax (in-short MMX). We had never used a micromax product before so were eagerly waiting for the TV. The packaging was superb (thanks to flipkart for easy buying and quick delivery), the courier boy had handled the product perfectly. Now, coming to the product, it was a big surprise to see the TV. We opened the carton and the tv had a premium metal finish bezel just like other big brands. The look of the TV dazzled me at first sight. We called up our local TV service-boy for installation. After the TV was fitted on the wall, it just changed the look of the wall. We had already installed TATA SKY+ HD for our 32 inch Samsung TV. The screen quality of the TV was the second thing that nearly fainted me. I was wondering that if we can get so much in this price. I could not see a mere pixel from a distant level. The colors were so bright that we could see every single and small detail of the picture. I am a huge fan of Cricket and watching cricket in this tv is much more fun than watching it on my 32" Samsung that to it costed me around 28000 three years back. This is a advice to buy an HD set-top box with this TV as the combination of both would be a perfect match. Now coming to the speakers which did a decent job in high noise levels. I am also using a TV-supported Home theatre of Sony which gives a very sharp and clear voice. No problems at all with this TV, the USB supports all file types even divx and avi which are not supported by big brands like Sony. Finally short sum-up: PROS:: GREAT LOOKS AND PREMIUM BEZEL. INEXPENSIVE GREAT COLOURS FULL HD HDMI SUPPORT USB SUPPORTS ALL GOOD FOR BIG HOMES and the biggest of all its INDIAN-MADE  CONS:: SPEAKER IS DECENT, NOT THE BEST. (A HOME THEATRE WOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE)  NOT A SMART TV (NO BUILT-IN WIFI).  So as you guys can see there r not much of cons and a bag full of pros at dis price. Buy wid no fear, njoy and chill.

flipkart.com	  I bought this from Flipkart in 34000 , V good quality , v good picture. Its an awesome buy at this price. While Same TV costs 60000+ in other good companies like LG , Samsung , Sony. Its Value for money. V good prodcut from Micromax,  Also Flipkart Service was v good , I purchased few Prodcuts from Snapdeal also. But thier service is very poor and also customer ca executives are not polite enough. However Flipkart rocks. 	4 stars	  02 Dec 2014 
flipkart.com	  When I first saw this TV for sale, I couldn't believe that Micromax can provide 49" TV with such a low price.  I tried to search on internet but couldn't find much info or review at all.  But price really attracted me so I played in blind and bought it.  Gati courier took only 2 days to deliver after placing the order( Valsad_Gujarat).  Believe me people, the picture quality is excellent.  Basel is really thin so TV looks really sexy.  Sound is Good Very Easy Installation   I had doubt before purchasing Micromax tv. I purchased two TVs SAMSUNG AND MICROMAX.  No difference in picture quality.  Both TV has same picture quality.  I would recommend to purchase Micromax because they are giving better features than others in low prices. ..:-)  	5 stars	  21 Nov 2014

So this review is based on my experience of 2 months, I am very happy with the overall quality of the TV and I am enjoying the viewing experience.  I had set out to buy a 32/40 inch FHD LED TV and was all set to go in for an LG/Samsung model. But this offer came along and I was getting an 49 inch FHD LED TV for the same price!   It is an golden offer and I would like to thank both Micromax and Flipkart as they have really provided a very good product at an very affordable price. 	5 stars	  16 Dec 2014

But I am very satisfied with the product thus far. I am not sure about Micromax service as I setup the TV myself ;) 	4 stars	  13 Dec 2014

flipkart.com	  (Do not buy MIcromax TV, especially from Flipkart)  I had ordered a micromax 49inch tv from flipkart for my wives birthday. There was a defect in the product (Severe white light leaking from all sides) and flipkart sent a micromax technician. The technician surveyed the issue and told me that the tv will be replaced within 10-20 days.  Then Flipkart cancelled my return request without looking into the matter. I had to then raise another return request. Then I got a call from Flipkart and he said he will be refunding the money instead of replacing the TV  I wanted a replacement as it was a gift for my wife and we have sentimental values attached to the TV. Both Flipkart and Micromax made ZERO effort to help me get a replacement. 	1 star	  28 Sep 2015

flipkart.com	  Perfect!! Hi, I have been using this TV for more than a month and it is superb as far now. Didnt have any plans for buying a new TV until I saw this for the offered price. I was not always interested in 3D or Smart TV or any kind of crap like that coz it doesnt make any sense to me. Connect a Laptop TV becomes supersmart and 3D-Don't like it even in theaters, just eye pain and head ache. So bought it with no high expectations. Waited for one week to receive this due to some transport problem, but that doesnt stop me from giving Flipkart service 5/5 coz they backed up issues very well.  Unboxing : Done by mmx service staff. I have wall mounted it.  Read complains from others about build quality. Nope! Not for me. Build quality is excellent (>Rs.80000 Tv's). Pros: ---------- 1. Cost! Indian Product! Not paying taxes on behalf of so called premium companies which makes 30-40K extra and show that its premium. 2. Picture quality is Fine not Excellent. 4/5. Not to mention Lg, Sammy, Sony has same untold stories. No one pays 80Ks and tells that the quality is ok or can live with it. 3. Build quality - Fine again. 4. Connected all cables (2 HDMI,2 USB, A/V, Analog, Cable, PC via VGA). All are working fine given input together. No Software glitches. 6. Color/contrast is just one point short of Crisp. 7. USB is nice to use but have to choose picture/video/text at the start. Same crappy feature like in Sony smart TVs. All standard formats are supported. 6. Audio quality and sound is good. Surround sound/music/theater....are nice. 7. Streaming YouTube Videos from HDMI is really great. 8. No particular complaints about Black levels although found little things somewhere. 9. Remote is Fine. Cons: ---------- 1. Menu graphics are built using 1980's programming. Icons seem to be unfinished. 2. I think no 5.1 output. Found out R/L channel audio output the hard way. 3. Enough but not much screen presets and audio presets. Only four are available among which two looks same, one is for dull and other is user. Vivid preset is Great!  If you are comparing this with any other Brand then your research might go on forever. Smart TV, 3D are fancy things just to increase the cost of the television. Think over 'are you going to load Facebook and youtube from Smart TV Apps which is way too slow to load' or 'use 3D feature once in your life just for Avatar(....hahaha)'. Rs. 2500 box will make this into a Smart T.V. if you want. I would recommend this on any given day.  Happy Buy!!   	4 stars	  24 Sep 2015 
flipkart.com	  TV picture & built quality is good Interface is little difficult to master. Sound quality is decent. Has 2 USB/HDMI ports (They should've put it in the side rather than in the bottom for easy access) The main problem is that the TV is succeptible to any electrical change. The TV will turn off for a moment if you turn off/on any electrical appliance in the house. (Putting a voltage stabilizer didn't help)  First I though its only with my TV, but later found in a pub that they are also facing the issue with 2 same TV they have... That is also turning off for every switch. Put a complaint for the same in customer care. Waiting for the response. 	3 stars	  23 Sep 2015

flipkart.com	  Hi folks i bought this TV from Flipkart after consulting my TV repair guy.  At first i was going for FULL HD SAMSUNG or SONY TV after seeing HD channels shown in any electronics showroom. Than when my TV repair guy told me that SAMSUNG and SONY have backlit LED panel issues after 1 year of use and SAMSUNG and SONY both charge around 20k for a new panel after the warranty is over, i decided to give the MICROMAX TV a try on his suggestion. And guess what MICROMAX TV worked like a charm and now its been almost 6 months and i am damm happy while watching HD channels. I am really happy that i took advise before buying an LED TV because showroom people are charging 5k more over Flipkart price.  Pros:1. Great color mixing technique used for a vivid colour experience 2. Its has a huge 49 inch display for ultimate experience  3. You can connect your PC to the TV via HDMI cable for watching FULL HD movies or for playing games ( I loved this facility to watch 1080p movies from my PC on the TV) 4. User interface is user friendly and easy to access and make necessary changes. 5. Bezels are very thin which adds to its looks. 6. The viewing angles are awesome with almost 180 degrees 7. Blacks are true blacks and not grey  8. You get MICROMAX 49 inch TV at the price of 32 inch SAMSUNG or SONY TV  Cons:1. HDMI Connection ports on bottom back side which are not easily accesible (Doesnt matter for one time cable setup)  2.Consumes 120Watt power meaning 300 rupees addition in your electricity bill (Standard 8 to 10 hours usage). 3. TV Stand is very attractive but wobbles at times so please prefer wall mounting. 4. TV is not 3D or Smart ( 3D movies come in size of 15GB and one has to bare the pain of wearing 3D goggles for 3 hours at a stretch and my PC is already smart ;) )   Special thanks to Flipkart people for making its a hassle free delivery. The TV arrived within 2 days of order. 	5 stars	  02 Sep 2015 
flipkart.com	  This TV was delivered in 2 two days & installed on the next day,Flipkart---5 Star.  Picture & Sound quality was average compared to Sony & Samsung, After working for three days the screen went blank only sound was coming. First thought there must be some problem with settings...but no luck called customer care they arranged for technician visit, technician call was to replace the tv.  Please Note:- Seller gives 30 days replacement warranty. I called customer care for replacement they offered me refund cause stock was not available at my location (Is this my problem) when seller say's 30 days replacement warranty then it's upto the seller to keep backup stock if something goes wrong. After wasting two days in hope of replacement finally took refund & ordered branded tv. Flipkart Customer Support---2 Star  NOTE:- PLEASE SPEND SOME MORE MONEY IN BRANDED TV, YOU WILL NOT BE IN FRUSTRATION.  	1 star	  30 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  I had no need to buy a TV but this was so well within budget that I couldn't resist. I don't see any reason why anyone should consider buying a Samsung, LG or Sony with the same features at 70, 000 rupees.  Picture and sound quality is awesome. Service by flipkart was wonderful.  I only have pros for this product as of now, no cons. 	5 stars	  30 Aug 2015

flipkart.com	  I ordered online using app on Aug 8, 2015 morning using SBI debt card. Hence I got a cash back of Rs 2000 from SBI and Rs 1000 from flipkart. The product was send to GATI within 12 hours of order and reached to me on Aug 11. Aug 12 at 4 PM the service engineer called and installed at my convenience at 5.30 PM table top as requested by me.  Flipkart automatically initiates installation only when their site says that the product was delivered. Unfortunately in my case GATI people took more than 10 hours for update, but it was not reflected in the flipkart site. Hence for saving delay in installation, I called flip and they assisted promptly on priority basis.   Packing was superb. Delivery and installation five star   The product is very good on the money invested. Sound and clarity very good. Service Engineer told me if I use trueHD dish tv settop box clarity will be more good (I use Dishtv). I will post another review after 30 days of experiencing the product  Thank you flipkart !   	4 stars	  13 Aug 2015 
flipkart.com	  Got it during the sale and so far so good. The service from flip kart was excellent.They even arranged for the installation with micromax. I won't say it is best but I would say the best for what you pay. I have a SD set-top box and the picture and sound clarity is good for SD channels. Overall Good if not the best. 	4 stars	  07 Aug 2015

flipkart.com	  I had an extensive survey of comparable products before going in for this 50'' LED of MM. Apart from certain subtle differences, I could not find out any major shortcoming in this TV. I had seen the TVs of same screen dimensions (put side by side, showing same channels) from Samsung, SONY, LG and MM and MM did not fare that badly. Further, given the price, it was an outright winner and a pocket friendly choice for me. I would not go into the technical details and jargons pertaining to pixels, resolutions and picture quality. However, the aesthetics, visual appeal, deliverables in terms of audio, video n options to connect more peripherals, user friendliness, overwhelmed me and I was a delighted customer. I exchanged my seven year old SONY BRAVIA LCD while ordering this one and also pocketed a small discount on EMIs. So, the deal was like a bread buttered on both sides for me. Now, coming to Flipkart services, they were brilliantly prompt. I had scheduled the delivery of the LED TV for 25th July (Saturday) afternoon and at 1100 hrs, this e kart guy called me up to check my availability at the address of delivery and before the TV was delivered to me, the engineering support team called me up to fix up a time for installation and DEMO. The TV was delivered and all the package contents shown and verified by the representative of e kart to me by 1300 hours. The TV was very nicely packed with its remote, wall mount and table stands. The technician installed and demonstrated (with my AIRTEL DTH) the unit on my wall by 1630. I'd ordered it on Thursday, the 23rd July and it was sitting nicely on my wall before Saturday evening. I checked both the HDMI and USB ports (2 each) and they responded without any hitch. The video and sound qualities, especially for HD channels were outstanding. It remains to be seen as how the TV performs over a period of time and how MM guys are in their customer care support but so far, it has been so good. Full marks to the TV and full marks plus some extra marks to Flipkart for making it a delightful shopping experience. Thanks 	5 stars	  27 Jul 2015

flipkart.com	  Yet again flipkart did a great job ..order was on time and installation guys from the micromax were on time ...coming to the t.v there is no compromise on the quality the picture is perfect full hd lives up to the expectation ......all on all its good product from micromax for the fraction of the price compared with sumsung and sony ...  A few things can be improved USB port does not cope well with portable hard disks and sound quality of the t.v is not that great but you can add home theater to improve it 	4 stars	  21 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have been using this TV for more than a month now and no complaints whatsoever. I am happy to have bought this as the pleasure of viewing HD in big television is an experience in itself. The RGB cables can be connected with the sound system to provide surround sound etc as the TV sound is decent but not that good. Its a very light TV set and very sleek also.  Anyone thinking of going for large dimension TV should definitely consider this. Best product at this price. 	5 stars	  20 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bought this tv on may 25 i gave complaint regarding this as some white dots are coming on the display then they replaced with new tv this itself taken 20 days after that i recieved new tv instead of old but now also i am getting same problem so i kept it for refund guys please dont go for this tv 	1 star	  15 Jul 2015

flipkart.com	  Got this delivered within the time mentioned and so the installation was done on time as well. Have been using it for more than a month now and see no issues. 	5 stars	  13 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  First of all Flipkart is best. Prompt delivery. Good customer service. Initially was not ready to buy this. But I had Micromax mobile and it is working still now. So decided to go for it. And I am not wrong. Really a good product in less than 30,000. I am using it from Saturday as Flipkart person refused to mount it on my ply panel. I got it fixed by carpenter. Overall good build quality. You can not expect more in this price.  Picture is also good on my SD set box also. You can not find any difference for HD picture when compare to other brands. HD rocks. Menu is very basic and limited. Sound is ok and enough for my 18 feet room. Music lovers should need external speakers.  Only problem I am facing is every time I have to on the TV by remote. This is wrong, If I directly switch off the TV without using remote next time it should start directly and no need to on it from remote. Don't know this is as designed or a defect. Not find any direct menu for color adjustment. I tried color temp but still not able to get the desired color level.  If any one knows how to reduce the color. Please let me know.  Overall a good deal. And recommended for medium budget guys.  	4 stars	  13 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  Simple the awesome tv. Thanks to flipkart for fastest the delievery and installation. I suggest to prefer this tv rather than the foreign brands which of too much cost. 	5 stars	  11 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  Good value for money. Prompt delivery and installation. ...... Would recommend it to all budget conscious users. Serves the purpose of a big screen with relative good clarity 	5 stars	  09 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  Initially i was hesitated to book this new brand TV but now i am realize i made a right decision in purchase this big TV at low cost, Picture clarity is really awesome, it has two pen drive port and support most of all formats but issue i found in playing Videos with AAC2,AAC3, AAC4 audio formats are not supported so before plug it to TV, you need to convert the Audio format to MP3 format to work in the TV otherwise audio will not work. On the whole it is really worth to buy this TV. Build Quality is OK and which is not comparable with high end TV's. HD Videos quality is awesome so I always download HD Videos to enjoy in this TV and I would recommend this TV Value for Money!!!. 	5 stars	  08 Jul 2015 
flipkart.com	  Bought it after research and reading reviews on flipkart. Picture quality is very good especially with the HD set top box. Sound is good enough, no problem there. Delivery was very prompt but they didn't accept credit card on COD.  Overall, very much satisfied with the purchase. 	5 stars	  07 Jul 2015

flipkart.com	  I ordered Micromax 50C5500FHD 124 cm (49) LED TV on 24th June 2015. Flipkart offered me Rs. 2000/- as exchange for my old working LG CRT TV. The TV was delivered on 26th June as per the delivery schedule and the same day technician came for installation. I was really impressed with prompt service of Flipkart.   After installation I was waiting to see the full HD picture quality of my TV. I was proud of my decision to get this huge LED TV. But my happiness did not last long. Within minutes of starting of the TV a big black patch of oval shape (around 12"x8") appeared on the top left of the TV screen . The technician was also stunned to see this event. Gradually horizontal line started appearing on the screen and after some time the entire screen was full of flickering white lines. The screen was full of lines, patches and of course picture also used to appear intermittently.   After seeing all these I called Flipkart customer care with broken heart. I was assured that TV will be replaced. But the return process what I was explained, was further tormenting.  I was told that first defective TV will be picked up. Once it reached to retailers warehouse then replacement will be sent. After hearing this I was really missing my old LG CRT TV. I was repenting for my decision to exchange.   Anyway, my Flipkart account shows that pick up has been scheduled by Monday, 29 Jun'15. I am just waiting for replacement. Don't know when will it come. Its really bitter experience with Flipkart was well as Micromax. I don't know why they want to push defective products to customers. What kind of quality control method they adopt that make customers suffer. I hope that I may be able to write next review once I get replacement. 	1 star	  28 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  This is a stunning product for my living room. A 49" LED TV available for this price is unbelievable until I had the product delivered and then promptly installed by the Flipkart staff.  The build quality is average which is excepted for this price point. Having only 2 HDMI ports is inadequate for my use. But this can be handled using an HDMI switch which I purchased from flipkart. Now my Blu Ray player, Set top box, Apple TV, Laptop can all be connected simultaneously.   The picture quality is at par with other brands. However I found that there is an LED leak on the screen which can be visible when the entire screen is black on the bottom left corner. This is a manufacturing issue which should have been rectified and for many other brands such as Sony such a piece would be rejected in the manufacturing itself.  I didn't ask to replace it as this issue is prominent when the entire screen is blank. While viewing normally the issue is barely perceptible.   Overall I am happy with the product for past 1 month and hope to use it for 2 years. Didn't expect someone will sell a 49" LED TV for this price! 	4 stars	  26 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Superb Quality and fantastic display....  As we know that we have different brands having different display and clarity. So in comparison to all Brands like Samsung, Sony and LG it is equivalent to these and so just go for it.  For Those who wanna enjoy HD channels its worth, but as it is 49 inch non HD will not be so clear and it wont be so clear in any other brands also even its Samsung or sony.  For those who are more looking into home theater type feel ad sound than dont go for this if your room is bigger than 225 sqft area because its sound output is lesser than samsung and sony so you wont be able to enjoy sound quality for bigger rooms.  Rest all is really awesome HDMI USB everything is perfect !!!!  Just go for it its worth considering all specs. 	5 stars	  23 Jun 2015

flipkart.com	  First of all thanks to Flipkart!  I saw this television while just surfing through! I found the product interesting and was inclined to buy, my cousin directed me to buy from a dealer in location instead of online, I visited the local dealer, price was high and they too have no demo! so decided to go with Flipkart. Between My cousin bought a samsung 42" on the same day when I ordered this with Flipkart at 21k more than what I paid for this TV, product was delivered on time as mentioned but my bad luck product was damaged. so Flipkart has taken ownership and replaced the product in 2 days from then! Though the installation guys made me nercous with some iunwanted issues, had nothing to complain about Flipkart Support!  Now coming to the review of this TV  Pro's  Excellent Display Nice picture quality Tested with Bluray player too! Can play all Mpv and VOB movies using the usb port  2 HDMI ports, 1 AV input, 2 USB ports. 1 AV output and 1 headphone out jack  Not so good   Position of the ports, not so easily accessible after mounting Audio definitely not the best, not so worst as well  For a budget friendly massive screen, you can go for this product!   	5 stars	  17 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Such a nice huge TV at an affordable price!!.The complete transaction was very smooth ie from the purchase to Installation.Was a bit worried that i may receive a defective product but the packing was too good and received it perfectly.

flipkart.com	  Its more than a week i received my TV but there is no one who has come in for installation yet..i m suppose to review the product bt as of nw i wanna review FLIPKART service..they have fooled me till date by saying that my number is not reachable..i have share 3 numbers...2 vodafone cell numbers and 1 MTNL landline...i cant believe tht only flipkart cant reach all three numbers...I have followed up on emails...twitter....customer care number...everything is just waste of time...  I seriously did not expect this kind of behavior from flipkart...i just feel frustrated and helpless....Flipkart should not sell products if they are not sure of installation time...atleast they should not commit...i feel cheated and willl never buy anything again here...  YOU GUYS HAVE JUST LOST A CUSTOMER AND I AM SURE I GOING TO SPREAD BAD WORD OF MOUTH ABOUT THIS INCIDENT....WORST PUBLICITY IS BAD WORD OF MOUTH REMEMBER THIS GUYS.... 	1 star	  11 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  Order placed on Saturday and TV delivered on Friday (Hyderabad) and also installation completed on same day.  Picture quality is good when connected to HD Setup box specially HD channels. Sound quality is OK and can be improved. Have minimal options for settings for display and sound.  Value for money considering the cost and quality. Playing most of the formats from USB. Display panel is not strong compare to LG/Samsumg/Sony - Of course we cant compare/expect the quality considering the price.  Low quality wall mount bracket.  When checked the price in showroom it is coming 5500 cheaper in flipkart. Thank you Flipkart for selling it lesser price.   Considering budget had to opt this TV otherwise I dont think so :-) and I hope min. it will work as expected for 2 to 4 years.  	4 stars	  08 Jun 2015

flipkart.com	  I was really feared of getting a fault product as other people got but luckily i didnt get into such situations..  TV has reached my expectations from Day 1 when it was delivered. (Dont expect a SONY level quality but you will be satisfied for what we have paid.)  Now i have a wonderful big LED at my home and made this a SMART TV (Bought Portronics Pandora) in flipkart.  Both make a wonderful combination - I now mirror my mobile and laptop easily and connect my TV to internet as and when required.  It has played almost all the formats i threw at it and without lag - 1080P runs pretty smooth from pen drive.  AMAZING DEAL - Thank you FLIPKART & MICROMAX 	5 stars	  01 Jun 2015 
flipkart.com	  With a great risk, I had purchased this Micromax TV. Looks like risks are not for me. Within a few days of usage, a vertical black line had developed within the LED screen. So, I requested for a return on Flipkart as it was within the stipulated 30 days period. After the request, Flipkart said, it would be sorted out by 23rd May. (Request posted on 21st May), which they failed and requested for 24th, then 28th then 30th May. They have failed all their commitments, and I am still watching the same TV with a line. I had doubts about Micromax quality but not Flipkart's service. Both of them failed me here. 	1 star	  01 Jun 2015

flipkart.com	  TV is pathetic in Quality, HDMI port 1 does not work at all, TV's menu keeps on shuffling on its own without even pointing remote to the TV, at time TV even shuts off automatically without turning on the sleep timer.  Contacted Flipkart in the hope of assistance, they have been giving only RUN-AROUND. TV was delivered on 7th May, I reported the Issue on the 8th, I am still waiting to see someone coming to my home and looking into it.  Flipkart is not at all competent in the part of customer service at all. Reps dont even know what they talk.  I have been cursing myself since the day it got delivered.  Very poor customer service..  THERE IS NO REFUND POLICY WITH FLIPKART, EVEN-THOUGH THEY HAVE A REFUND TAB ON ORDER DETAILS PAGE - DON'T KNOW WHY??  GO WITH AMAZON OR SNAPDEAL OR ANY-OTHER SITE BUT FLIPKART.. GOD FORBID IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH YOUR ORDER U R SOOOO STUCK, AS I AM. 	1 star	  18 May 2015

flipkart.com	  I had ordered this product through Flipkart. The delivery of the product was quick and was sent in couple of days but the product had a damage. Also the connector to the speaker/woofer is not working. I had raised a return request as soon as received the product with damage but even after 10 days have no update. Flipkart keep on sending message that your problem will be on 10 and then another message on 11 and then on 12 and so on.   Please do not fool people and provide genuine product. Do not buy frm here are the price is cheap since they send damaged product and not new one. 	1 star	  13 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  I must give it a 5 star ratings. Product is fantastic. Flipkart services are unparallel. Shipment was average as vendor took more than desired time. Flipkart arranged my installation on the same day. The representative was really patient man who installed it flawlessly. The picture is top of the world. At this rate it is worth buying this product. I strongly recommend others for this product. Thanks Flipkart and Micromax for such deals. 	5 stars	  13 May 2015 
flipkart.com	  Instead of spending 1 to 2 lakh(sony/LG) for 50 inch TV, you will get this within your budget (30K), and its worth of cost, I have been using this from past one month, No complaints  awesum product, flipkart deliverey is good, and installation done within 24 hours ! great :-)  My suggestion is just go for it, without any second thoughts, and its equivalent to sony/LG 50inch with HD setup box :-) 	5 stars	  13 May 2015

flipkart.com	  I bought this TV in the month of january 15. After i have purchased nearly 10 of my friends and relatives have bought this TV. That shows the quality of this LED tv from micromax. MM has done wonderful job by offering at this price. simply close your eyes and go for this TV. People say it has only 60hz refresh rate but you could feel that only when you watch news scrolling going at very high speed. otherwise you could not find any diff between any other high hz tv and this one.All other big brand Tvs charge the customer just to make high profit. nothing else. 	4 stars	  03 May 2015

flipkart.com	  Was looking for a 50" TV and given Micromax's recent rise in reputation across board, took the plunge - given that every other option was atleast 10k higher!  But, what a shitty experience, while the colors etc. are not bad, the Operating system is like the old DVD players. Every icon feels clumsily made, the subtitles appear almost at 1/3rd height from the bottom - looks like somebody took the software on the smaller TVs and bolted it on top of this. If you forward your movie, the subtitle sync is gone (and there is no way to fix it) and there is no "Resume from stop" feature. And I could go on about the lack of polish and irritating, small bugs.  Given my other TV is a Smart 40" Samsung, this feels like a piece of crap. Thankfully, there was a "one in a million" (as per the technician) manufacturing defect (Panel depressed in 3 spots) in my TV and Flipkart has only a refund option, so I will be getting my money back and putting it back in the tried-and-tested Samsung brand, even if it means 15k more.  Never again please! (Note to self!) 	1 star	  02 May 2015

Once the micromax guys hear that you've brought from flipkart, they show no interest in attending you Ive been a regular buyer from flipkart, but this time its left me very dissapointed 	1 star	  30 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Writing on day1. When i 1st saw this TV i couldn't believe this TV is for just 300000 Rs . True HD LED. Pictures are amazing. Will review after using some days. 	5 stars	  29 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  a very good product and excellent service in delivering the TV on time by flipkart. Both micromax and flipkart rocks. 	5 stars	  27 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Hi   I ordered this LED after researching it online and watching it for 2-3 months at my brothers home. and moreover with a price tag of 27990 (After 3k+2K discount) it was a good deal. Firs things first - Flipkart delivery rocks , But there Customer Service is poor, Installation was quick and perfect the technician was sound and fast enough to answer all queries related to product  As per TV : Micromax has done some good work on the Quality part , It is very nice to watch the TV with good Video and Audio Quality Almost most of the Video formats go through - i palyed them using Hard disk 2 USB which are enough  Look is very nice and Sleek design make sit even more Stylish  Sound part is quite good considering the other biggers brands Definitely very good compared to other bigger brands and for the price offered  Very Happy with the product , This is the second time we have bought this LED in our Family and it is truely a good purchase worth for every single Rupee  Thanks Micromax  	5 stars	  27 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Overall it is an average product. The biggest issue is SOUND and will need urgent attention from Micromax. I do not want to return the product, however this is a biggest problem this TV has. I am calling Micromax to fix this issue.  1. The user interface is very old and insufficient.  2. The sound quality extremely poor. Will need external audio. 3. This will need firmware update and I look forward to receiving one.  4. The PC interface worked well at 1920 x 1080 resolution, the video quality was acceptable the audio quality extremely pathetic, you can hardly hear anything.  5. The USB operation works however the UI is bad. It is totally unintuitive. I ended up deleting some files inadvertently.  6. Scan rate is low however acceptable.  7. Yet to check DVD and HDMI operations.  	2 stars	  26 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I have searched all branded and small brand and no brand television and skewed to this Indian Television maker for Indian(Aam Admj)  The television as good as any other 50 inch television you may find  Why you should not discard this television  Its price is the major factor The display enormous 50 inch Looks very sleak bezel just 1 cm SRS is good enough for most of families Connection ports as many as you may need   Why you should not bother  The back side is little bit more plasticy yet no one sees from back it is hung on wall Micromax-they are not well established but they have proven their metal in smartphone sector same they will repeat here I hope  I have used for 3days only once I have enough time I will write more about functionality and bugs in this television.  For now there isn't a single issue I faced  For fact SD QUALITY is a nasty business on 50inch television so get your set top boxes upgraded or get 1080 p movies into hard disk.  While using my 1tb hard disk on TV USB I didn't know where play button was and I have deleted my favourite movie collection DARK NIGHT TRIO i first felt very angry on TV remote for the design , so please be careful since its one click to delete here than two clicks to play or open a file. 	5 stars	  24 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I bot this Tv in Oct 2014 after 4 months of working properly all of a sudden the display went blank..We contacted the micormax customer care .The very next day the Sevice people arrived and declared this was a faulty TV and they would replace it...Two months have passed the Service Center people are always delaying the date of devilry of the TV to be replaced and are very rude they keep on saying TV has arrived but at bhiwandi warehouse.They are asking me to go and get it from the warehouse....Frustrated i called up Flipkart customer Care on 14th April 2015.The concerned team from Flipkart said that they would handle this matter and I would get a reply by 19th April...No revert from Flipkart on 19th April.....Again Flipkart postponed the date to 22nd April still no revert now yesterday I got a mail saying that they will revert on 26th April.... Really frustrated as i exchanged my good working Samsung Flat screen TV for Mircomax TV...which is now not working for 2 months and no help from anyone... REALLY REGRET the decision i took to buy this micormax TV 	1 star	  23 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  i don't think the screen size are per specification mentioned here, it was just 100 cm width, one of the USB port is not working. User navigation menu are so poor and not upto the mark 	1 star	  21 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  1. Picture Quality - Decent but not on par with big brands like SONY/LG/Samsung/Panasonic. Having a hard time while playing 1080P movies. 720p movies is playing liek a charm. Response time is a bit slow when playing with USB or HDD.  2. Sound Quality- 10W*2 speakers just about does the job. It is very low when played hollywood movies/series. have to go till 50-55 to hear.  3. Build Quality: Very Good for the cost on offer (you wont have the sheer WOW experience of Samsung or LG or a Sony)  4. 2 USB ports available and it plays most of the video formats i have. :)  5. Ports are awkwardly placed and are difficult to access   6. TV was shipped with beautiful chrome table mounts(i just love them), wall mount accessories, remote control with 2 AAA batteries.  7. User interface could have been better in fact much better. It looks like you are playing with DOS GUI in PC.  8. HD content reproduction is not on par with the LED TV's of premium make, but just about does the job.   I bought it with 30K, Overall pretty satisfied with the make and its definitely a value for money proposition. 	4 stars	  18 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Really happy with the purchase.  Great clarity with Dishtv HD Setop box connection. I am not a picky guy when it comes to availability and features. As long as the tv runs fine at 1080p quality, I have no complaints.  btw, planning to buy one more for myself as I am a gaming addict and have a PS4 that is currently connected to an Akai 40" 1080p LCD tv.I would not have purchased the Akai tv(Costed me 29k INR!!!) 1 year back if I had known Micromax would be releasing such great televisions at such a great price point. 	5 stars	  15 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  I just bought this tv 3 weeks back and first of al thanks for the flipkart for the on time delivery. Before buying a Led TV just see wheather it fits to ur room.If u have small room size go for a small size tv .My room is too small but i bought this 49 inch tv so i suppose to watch it very closely so tat i can see the pixels breaks for a 1080i videos.And this tv is best suited for watching QHD and above resolution videos. Since the size of the TV is big you can see the pixels break on 1080p videos but if u watch 1080p videos at decent distance pixel break is not visible. Other than that its a best tv for this prize range 	4 stars	  15 Apr 2015 
flipkart.com	  Hi,   I wanted to know if I purchase this product from flipkart anyone from micromax will come to install this product @ my home or they will give me demo ? if yes then how is that possible 	1 star	  10 Apr 2015

flipkart.com	  This TV of 49inch really has a good look in the hall. It is worth buying. Please ensure you purchase a stabilizer for the same and ensure use USB device fully protected against virus before it is plugged in the TV.  You will have a very good feel. Blue Ray DVD's are very appealing when viewed.  Service from Micromax Customer care is prompt and very cooperative.  I am happy buying this product. 	5 stars	  27 Mar 2015

flipkart.com	  I purchased this tv from flipkart, so for so good. Overall satisfied, i do not find any major difference in samsung product and this. With this price range we can good to go. Error ratio of micromax is greater than other brand. I have seen the review and taken risk, but product was good for me. 	5 stars	  19 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  Its worth every penny, the clarity is simply superb!!! Sound Quality is OK not too bad..!  I saw this product display in Croma, before I could decide on purchasing online. While they were playing a HD channel on other much branded product too (Sony) which was displayed above the MicroMax TV, trust me this one looked much sharper in resolution, i could not believe my eyes...:-) Go see it for your self if you like too..  Also, its much cheaper in Flipkart with this offer, delivered before the deadline as always, Flipkart ROCKS!!! The Service was very Professional and definitely, they just raised the BAR high now. Way to go!  To my knowledge FLIPKART has always got an awesome reputation in quality products,. service and delivery - HATS OFF!!! Thanks Again, Keep Rocking!  If you are thinking whether to get this one or not - just blindly go for it, your TV viewing experience is just about to change forever :-) If your going to watch any HD channels, you might not believe your eyes.. Get ready..! 	5 stars	  16 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  its ok to buy.......................................................................................................................... 	2 stars	  12 Mar 2015 
flipkart.com	  First I want to say thanks to Flipkart for the top quality service and price the give. Before buying this product did some market research myself and found everybody else was selling at higher price.  About Product: 2 words - Simply Awesome... :) I'm someone who has always gone with Sony or LG product. I have 32" Sony LED, 42" LG Smart TV.... but after buying this my first thought was Micromax is really good. I can't say it has anything less than them. Bright Crisp picture quality, perfect as should be. Its 60 Htz... yes... but it DOESN'T matter... we don't get 100 Hz signal anyways No Optical output... which I missed..but I connected with HDMI to my home theatre which works even better.  All 5 stars to Micromax...keep up the good work. 	5 stars	  27 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  screen is huge and product is value for the money.  Pros 1.Huge screen 2.Good screen clarity (prefer HD channels) 3.Almost plays all formats 4.low power consumption 5. Very economical when compared with other tv brands of same size Cons 1.Cheap bulit quality at the rear side of the tv (Not a issue at all) 2.Sound is not good when u play it from usb 3.No audio jack for external speaker connection  Service from the flipkart team is great and i appreciate it . If possiblel ! prefer 50 inch tv it has more contrast ratio, audio jack and less power consumption (95 w) 	4 stars	  23 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  I ordered this tv on 4th jan 15 and delivery was on 7th jan within time as given by flipkart, the delivery boys were very supportive and delivered the tv in time, so for delivery i would like to give 5 stars, the installation was quick within 4 to 5 hrs, the tv quality is very good, no need to spend so much money in branded tv, If u have extra money then u can go for other brands, but this tv is very good, Picture quality of tv is awesome and sound quality is also very good. No need to think too much just go for it. 	4 stars	  22 Feb 2015

flipkart.com	  I was just looking for a big screen TV with Full HD and basic LED and I found this to be very good fit. Reviewed TV, went to Pai international to check the physical appearence and it has very attractive look. The features and all upto the mark with par to the international brands. it has 2 HDMI, 2 USB and VGA connector, same features in Onida was costing me around 49k where as this got for better deal of 34K.   Flipkart was good in delivering the product and total credit to their services. They just delivered the product within 24 hours and installation and demo took place within other 2 days.   Using this TV for past 10 days and no issues. I have HD tv connection and the picture quality is very good.   You can give a try blindly for this product and enjoy the fun!  Cheers! M 	5 stars	  03 Feb 2015 
flipkart.com	  Bought this TV about 2 weeks back and I couldn't be happier.   What more do you need from a TV apart from 1080p? All the added stuff of UHD/4k/Smart/Curved Screen and even 3d are nothing more than marketing gimmicks to drive up the price of TVs. Today's content requires only 1080p for BluRays and 1080i for TV channels.   This is exactly where this TV scores points - it is just a TV and it is brilliantly inexpensive! A 49" LED for 33k!   Flipkart service was good. Delivery and installation was done as promised.   The only thing I'm unhappy about is the lack of extra HDMI ports (has only 2), but that's just me trying to nitpick. 	5 stars	  02 Feb 2015

flipkart.com	  On the whole superb at a reasonable price The performance of the TV is fine. Installation done is perfect. No complaint.Thank you KAILAS 	5 stars	  26 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  pixels are not so good as compare to sony or lg led ...... 49 inch for 1080p led needs equal optimisation for pixels  thats why video quality is little bit low sound is not so loud but clear if u need base i have to buy another speakers no built in amplifier 2 usb ports is great feature of this led  overall it is good 	4 stars	  21 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  2 week ownership report Good Bits: 1. Excellent screen, especially HD channels on the DTH at home render exceptionally well 2. Thin Bezel making it look quite sleek, its actually not very thin from a top down view, but how does that really matter, its not like you watch the back side of your TV all the time. 3. Above Par speakers 4. still cant get around the fact that it comes at less than half the price of what the south Koreans and Japanese price similar products at, and yet delivers maybe 95% or more than what features they offer. yes you might get some extra gizmos on the SK&J products, but you really wont be using any of that jaaz most of the time.  Bad Bits: 1. The HDMI slots are placed weirdly, quite tough to reach for it in case you have the TV wall mounted. 2. only 2 HDMI slots, then again, how many are enough these days. 3. no WiFi or smart OS - but a Chromecast dongle should take care of all that for another couple of k ( so this is not really a bad bit, more like a neutral comment)  would i recommend it - Definitely, for sure, YES. fact is, 2 of my friends went ahead and bought the TV as soon as they saw it at my place. 	5 stars	  21 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  We have received TV as per schedule. Packing is good and TV is good. I am not happy with installation part. The service engineer is not skilled. He doesn't know how to install TV. We had to help to connect TV with set top. We suggest to give proper trainings to service engineers for installations and repairs. Except installation part rest is excellent. TV is good. 	4 stars	  14 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  It is only a week since I am watching this television after installation. First time the product was defective when the technician came for installation. I got a replacement after a little bit of fight with Flipkart. The product is really a value for money spent. Features as given in description.  One thing I felt was that the price difference between 40 inch and 49 inch television by micromax is too much. 	4 stars	  13 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  The product is no doubt worth the price paid for, but the demo was not properly arranged for. The person who came for installation was only interested in getting it wall mounted. He could not give explanations on why the AV output was provided in the TV. He could not explain why my VCD was not showing a clear picture on the TV when connected to the Component ports given on the back of the TV. Someone (a real good engineer knowing the product thoroughly) needs to really come and give a proper tutorial on the working of the various functions of this product.  I will not deny that the product is good and would surely recommend it to others.  R T Narang, Pune. 	4 stars	  13 Jan 2015

flipkart.com	  I ordered This MMX-49" LED TV on 4th Jan-'15 & got it delivered on 7th in good condition. Installation was not satisfactory with the candidate sent by Flipkart. He was in a hurry to leave the place as soon as the installation is completed. Not having a capability to explain about the features that this TV has & how to use it in safe manner. this is the only NEGATIVE POINT OF FLIPKART. IF THIS POINT IS BEEING TAKEN CARE BY FLIPKART, THEN REALLY EVERY ONE CAN ENJOY THE GREAT JOB DONE BY FLIPKART. Thanks a lot to Flipkart. 	4 stars	  10 Jan 2015 
flipkart.com	  I'm very much pleased that I took the decision to buy micromax, relatively new company in TV although famous for mobile phones. But it was a wise decision.

The price is low yet I don't see any notable compromise in the quality or the features of the TV. This produce is just amazing! Micromax rocks!!! 	5 stars	  26 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Excellent customer service by Flipcart. I had some issue with the TV but was replaced and installed by Flipcart within 24hours of technician's review. The TV is really good and value for money.But one need to spend another 3000 on the stabilizer and 2 or 3 thousand on HD Set top box. Be prepared to shell out around 500 for HD channel monthly subscription.Using normal set top box in this TV is useless.  To mention again very courteous customer service representative's of flipcart, needn't have to wait for long on phone for the issue to be resolved.Thank u flipcart. 	5 stars	  21 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Flipkart Transaction, communication, Delivery and Installation all Perfect. Of course not exactly on the scheduled time, but everything accomplished on the scheduled date.   Regarding the TV,  Pros :  1. Overall Picture Quality and Sound Quality is above average to good.  2. Built Quality is just an average compare with my previous experience with Panasonic.  3. Software could have been better. But for normal users and new comers it doesn't matter.  Cons :   1. Sound Levels between AV and USB has Huge Difference, So while switching USB to AV , we need to properly reduce sound and switch. (Not a Big Deal)   2. Seems, there was a Software issue with Multiple Audio Track Movies. there is no sound from any track. Its works perfectly with single audio Movies. :(  =====================================  Over all... not excited... But surly Satisfied. =====================================  	4 stars	  20 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Brought this from Flip kart and after installation found some back-light issue on the right side bottom corner, escalated to flip kart and micromax service person came and without my knowledge opened up and loosened all the screws and tried some experiment and left it with loosing screws and left 2 screws on the table and he did not respond on my phone also.  Not happy with tv and service of micromax, i had asked for replacement or exchange or refund for the same...and still in process don't know when these people will respond.  totally disappointed with this TV and service of micromax:( 	1 star	  13 Nov 2014

flipkart.com	  Flipkart delivered this in 2 weeks, the delivery was slow, may be because, that it has to be transported with much care. The product was delivered with out any damages. Demo and installation was also scheduled by Flipkart itself. I checked with local dealer for Sony and LG, Sony cost around 114000 and LG at 94000. Where as this TV is only 34000, its a value buy. I have a Sony Bravia LED 32 inches at home already, I dont feel any difference in the display or picture quality. So guys go for Make in India! 	5 stars	  04 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  This range of tv is market cost is to high but micro max giving cost wise cheep...... Good ................. 	4 stars	  03 Nov 2014 
flipkart.com	  Definitely the best price in the market, I did not wanted to spend a lot so went for this one... saw the price on FK then went to local shops to actually she a live demo and I just could not make out the deference.. 5/5 for the TV..  The installation guy was acting too smart, was trying to sell his own cables and was very rude.. so I will take one start of that... also he marked him self 10/10 in his report when he took my sign, so that was kind of not good.   So just be ware of the installation guys they will try to sell you cables which you may not require. As I was any ways about to upgrade my set top box to HD from normal.  If you don't want to spend more and want to still be happy.. go for it :)  I am a happy man 	4 stars	  02 Nov 2014

bestbuy.com	I was looking for LED TV to replace my old analog TV. I didn't want to spend too much obviously after having that old TV this long. Also I wanted a larger 32". I saw good reviews although this seemed to be a non-popular brand. I watched prices of different brands same features and Insignia was far less. I eventually found one that was returned labeled scratched but I could not find anything wrong with it and all accessories still in the package. They did not have a box but they wrapped it nicely with bubble and plastic wrap. It turned out to be a great buy since the money I saved I used to purchased the extended warranty. Good pic quality. Fit perfect in bedroom armoire.	5.0	2015-09-26

bestbuy.com	I have had my TV for just over a year, its only a few weeks past the warranty and it no longer works. I am having issues getting the TV to power on, and if it does power on it won't stay on. I did some research and found that this is a fairly common issue with insignia TVs. Guess I should've done some research before buying and I suggest you do the same. My advice though, you get what you pay for, so steer clear of this TV unless you want to start shoveling money into it a year later trying to buy replacement parts to fix it yourself (since tech support is as much as the tv cost if its out of warranty).	2.0	2015-09-26

bestbuy.com	You know by the price that this isn't the world's best television, but for $160, you can't beat it. I bought it to use with my Xbox One. I play my Xbox from about seven or eight feet away, and there is nothing at all wrong with the picture from that distance (I can't speak for much at other distances if you're picky about the resolution of your HDTVs). It's a good size for a bedroom, and if I were to need another TV sometime in the near future, I would likely get another one of this one. Since it's not full 1080p, some of you may not be super satisfied, but the picture is plenty clear in my opinion. Great TV if you're on a budget. Setup is super easy. I would highly recommend.	5.0	2015-09-13

bestbuy.com	10 years or so my parents bought a 32 inch LCD for their home. It was a Toshiba and they paid close to $1500 if I recall correctly.<br />FFW to 2015: I just paid $139 for 32 LED that picturewise beats that Toshiba in every way. This is a very basic TV but efter spending about 20 min tuning the picture, using my Panasonic plasma as reference, I'm shaking my head in wonder. I'm watching UFC on UVERSE and the picture quality is remarkable, for the money. I will also add a Roku stick and then I have all the video media options I need.<br />The sound is totally ok and I actually find the clarity quite good.<br />This our new bedroom TV and the first 5 hrs of ownership has been an unmitigated success.	5.0	2015-08-23

bestbuy.com	We purchased this TV so we could get OTA transmission...we cut the cord and decided to upgrade our TV. It has a beautiful picture, very clear and true color, and decent sound. Honestly, for the price, I don't know if you could do better! The one downside is that it's hard to know how to find stations that it doesn't locate when you do the antenna search. For example, when I did the antenna search, it missed several stations because I was having trouble getting transmission at that moment. I had to look up how to add these stations...it's not an obvious feature and it's not in the instructions. Apparently, this is a feature lacking on this TV that others have complained about for several years. But other than that, the sound and picture are good for a smallish room.	4.0	2015-08-19

Predominantly using HD devices, I was reluctant to go for a "lesser quality" picture for the sake of size. After speaking with an associate I decided that any slight difference in picture quality would be offset by more overall visibility. I'm very glad I did, this TV was a great value. Picture is great. Ideal for small to medium sized bedrooms. Also can double as a computer monitor. Overall very pleased.	4.0	2015-08-11

amazon.com	I snagged this TV for $310 at Walmart.  Sweet deal evm if I had paid $388. For the money you get all you can ask for.  Great picture and apps for playing video and music.  All the hookups you'll need too.<br /><br />But there are a few things sacrificed quality wise in order to manufacture a TV  at such a low price point.  Structurally, the plastic framing on this thing is DIRT CHEAP.  You can bend it by just pushing it a little.  If it takes a fall it will certainly not survive.  I highly recommend a good mount so it is not knocked over by kids or dogs.  Being cheap, it is wayyyy light though, so mounting is a cinch.  Secondly, the added video features meant to improve quality don't work at all from what I've experienced.  The best way I've found for maximum picture quality is to go into the &#34;more picture &#34; settings, turn off all features except for zones, and on the picture presets use ANYTHING but standard.  Standard is meant to save energy, and as you know, that lowers the brightness making your picture less good.<br /><br />So with a good mount and some tweaking in the video settings, this is a great television at a great price.	5.0	October 5, 2015

amazon.com	After 5 weeks of viewing, this television stopped powering on/off by remote and from the power button on the back. As well, the screen size is stuck in small viewing and you cannot access any of the apps for viewing such as Netflix or amazon. At first we thought it needed batteries in the remote however, not the case. We have to turn it off by removing the power source. I would certainly like a replacement however I am 1 week past the 30 day guarantee. As always, the shipping is on time and packaged well.	1.0	October 4, 2015

The second one--the replacement that Amazon sent me--worked for about 3 weeks, and then just stopped working one day while i was watching TV. The TV turned off, and i could not turn it back on. It was as if the power on the TV just failed.<br /><br />I have spent hours and hours on hold with amazon customer service because of this tv. DO NOT BUY IT. the picture quality is good, but it simply doesn't work. I have had problems with Vizio products in the past. I think their products have many known issues.	1.0	October 4, 2015

I could not get this to connect and support said it had to be a secured network??? I added a password to my network and it was able to connect to all the content apps like NetFlix and Amazon but it would say the network was disconnected when I tried to go to the app store to download new apps. They said to wait a couple days and make sure it gets all the updates then call them back if it still will not connect.<br />I had no problem getting through to their support and they were very helpful. Will update if time cures the problem.<br />Update on 6/29/15: After 5 calls to Vizio support the person I talked to a few minutes ago had me change the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and everything worked fine. Just go into the network settings and then to manual setup. Turn DNS from ON to OFF and put in 8.8.8.8 for the DNS and everything worked fine and I c... Read more	4.0	October 2, 2015

amazon.com	I am very happy with this purchase. When I went through the TV selection process, I knew I was looking for a 60+ inch HD Smart TV. I had considered 4K but decided against it since there is not much you can watch in 4K yet. I also spoke with someone that writes for &#34;Wired&#34; magazine who gave me some good tips. I have included below the general summary of why I chose this TV as well as links to websites that can go into much more detail on pros and cons.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Vizio generally has the best bang for the buck. The company produces TVs with good picture quality at a highly reduced price to its competitors. The general consensus is that Samsung will produce slightly better picture quality, but I and others I have spoken with, do not think the price trade-off is not worth it. A comparable TV made by Samsung (&#34;Samsung UN65J6300&#34;) will run you about 50% more than this TV. I have looked at the picture on both TVs and was honestly unable to tell a difference. When you buy Vizio, you do need to pay attention to the panels the TV uses because Vizio will use different panels for different sized TVs (of the same model). Basically, the higher Hz numbers in a panel generally equate to improved motion resolution (i.e., reduced blurring). This TV has a 120Hz panel, but if you drop down to the 60-inch, the panel is only 60Hz.  If you are looking for a lot more detail, I have provided below links to some of the review websites I used when making this purchase.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.<br /><br />http://www.cnet.com/products/vizio-e-series-2015/<br />http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/best<br /><br />Best,<br />Dave	5.0	October 2, 2015

Surely others will appear. 1 star for not testing your product before selling. Should have bought a samsung.<br /><br />Update:<br />After connecting to my WiFi to connect to Netflix, the TV automatically updated. WiFi has not worked since. I've tried the factory reset, service reset, power cycle and hard reset. It just keeps getting better. Sigh.	1.0	October 2, 2015

I had this out of the box for 2 hours, just long enough to get the stand attached and the channels programmed in, then I sit down to watch some afternoon television and it becomes unresponsive, the only way to shut it off is to kill the power, when you shut it off and turn it back on you can push 2 buttons on the remote before it locks up again.  So I contact Amazon about sending it back and they send me a return address label right away and have my money refunded before I get back from the UPS store.  After reading the reviews this seems to be a common problem for Vizio and I will never purchase anything made by them again.	1.0	September 30, 2015

amazon.com	My roommate bought this TV from Best Buy, which was enough time for me to fall in love with the smart TV aspect. So I ordered this one and it is the same but a year newer. I love that I can play YouTube videos from my phone to it and having the Netflix button on the remote is a huge time saver. For some reason it is not syncing up to my DirecTV DVR correctly but I think it is the DVR not the TV because as soon as I turn off the DVR and turn it back on it works. Otherwise it works great with the WIFI features and my PS3.	5.0	September 29, 2015

amazon.com	The package arrived undamaged and in New condition. I read several reviews and worried about this model a bit. As for my experience, this Tv does really well as just a TV. The smart functions on this Tv have cause mine to freeze up and refuse to respond to my remote, a universal remote that was properly programmed, and the tv's physical power button. After power cycling the TV 3-4 times I gave up on the smart functions and disconnected it from the internet and viola it works perfectly. I run Netflix through my Xbox anyways so it's not a huge loss for me. Still a nice TV with great detail and color.	3.0	September 29, 2015

amazon.com	TV has been performing beautifully, connecting to wifi and different accounts (Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, etc) was easy. Main concerns were two noticeable points where the screen protruded from the plastic frame, possibly from poor assembly or packaging, and the lack of a remote. The TV only houses a power button, making it impossible to use for literally anything until you either purchase the brand name remote, or go the way I did and find a programmable universal remote for about 1/6th the price. TL;DR- Good buy, not great thanks to some inconveniences	4.0	September 29, 2015
amazon.com	I like the picture quality and the sound isn't bad for a cheap TV. I am very disappointed in Vizo/Yahoo's app ecosystem though. I wish I would have looked into it a little closer before purchasing. I assumed the major sports apps (MLB TV, NFL Gamepass, MLS) would be there, but they aren't. It isn't a huge deal since I also have my Desktop hooked up to this TV for gaming so I can just stream it on my computer and display it on the TV, but I was disappointed that I don't have the option of streaming through an app (I'm lazy sometimes and don't want to turn my computer on and bring the mouse and keyboard over to my bed from the desk). Overall, it has a great picture for the price.	4.0	September 29, 2015

amazon.com	Considering it is a less expensive TV, it is a great buy. The TV is working out great. It has good quality at 1080p and comes with good speakers. The only negative is the clicker, which isn't very comfortable to use (can sometimes be annoying to click the buttons, but I have larger hands) but it still works fine. It would have been nice if the TV had buttons directly on the TV in case you lose the remote, but overall, this TV was a great purchase and I dont regret buying it. I would recommend the TV and i would buy it again.	5.0	September 28, 2015

I had ver high expectations which were not met.<br /><br />If you want a set that in close ups shows details like hairs on the face and wrinkles in the skin, this is not the set to own. Out of the box color settings were completely off. Even once calibrated it showed strong yellow on  the normal setting. Which brings me to my next point it is extremely difficult to set this TV up and be 100 percent satisfied. Set was returned. Still love Vizio products just not the E series tvs.<br /><br />If you want tv that	2.0	May 1, 2015
amazon.com	WARNING TO ALL POTENTIAL BUYERS:<br /><br />This TV has a glaring flaw that causes it to practically be unusable if it is connected to a network with a device that has filesharing enabled. If you are like me are on a campus internet, it is basically a paper weight due to it freezing when it turns on. With no solution to fix the problem.<br /><br />This is an issue that Vizio has swept under the rug with their smart TVs for years, they refuse to fix it. Vizio support told me to return it and look for another brand.	1.0	September 28, 2015

Then the screen began to randomly flash brightly in some segments and dark in others,with jagged horizontal lines across the screen.

When it was working I would rate it 3 stars for performance and 5 stars for value.	1.0	September 27, 2015

amazon.com	I purchased the 50” version of this Vizio a couple months ago for my apartment at college. Overall, this television is exceptional but like most products has some flaws. Here are a few categories.<br /><br />Picture:<br />My roommates and I have a relatively small living room so it was hard to set up the television in an ideal location. Therefore, we have a sliding door to the left that should, as most televisions would, produce a glare. Somehow this television has never given us a problem with the glare, which is perfect for our setup. Along with that, the few HD channels that are provided to us through our cable provider have great picture quality.<br /><br />Remote:<br />Frankly, I think this is a horribly designed remote. Sure, the buttons aren’t bad and they do provide some shortcuts if you are looking for Netflix, iHeart Radio, or Amazon Instant Video. However, the whole back of the remote comes off for the battery replacement, which could easily be changed to a snap on back to make it more secure. Because the back is unstable, if you are trying to change channels the back just sort of slides off. This is an annoying feature that may need to be fixed with duct tape.<br /><br />Sound:<br />I cannot give my opinion on the sound due to external subs connected to the television.<br /><br />Price:<br />I give the price rating for this product a 5/5. This Vizio is listed at $528, but with Amazon Prime I received a $30 discount. Once you add in Amazon’s deals of free shipping and no tax, the total comes to $498. Quite the bargain for a 50” television let alone a Smart TV.<br /><br />Basically, if you can deal with the back of the remote, then this item is a steal. A 50” 1080p Smart LED HDTV with this price is practically unheard of, especially for a VIZIO. This is the television for you, whatever size you choose.	4.0	September 24, 2015

amazon.com	It's a nice looking TV - the bezel is very thing and has a nice, simple design.  I could care less about the apps - I have all of those through other devices, so I'm really just interested in the TV.<br /><br />I'm not sure if there's something special about the 28&#34; TV, but there aren't many 1080p options in that size - and this is no exception @ 720p.  Maybe for that reason, the picture isn't nearly as clear as my 24&#34; computer monitor or my 10 year old, 46&#34; LCD TV (which is 1080p).  The picture in the VIZIO appears aliased (jagged edges) and the colors aren't very good, even after several attempts at adjusting.  The picture looks like what you would expect coming from a cheap TV that you'd find in a motel.<br /><br />The price is nice and it's nice to look at while turned off, but I wouldn't recommend this as a TV that you will use often - it just isn't very good as a TV.	3.0	September 23, 2015

amazon.com	Waited until the 2016 models were close to coming out, so I could get this for less. I like Vizio and this is my third generation set I got from them (other two still work used in another house). Doesn't have PIP but I'm not sure anyone offers that now, I guess I'm still living in the 90's. I don't use the smart TV functions since I use a laptop to access the web. I'm about 10 feet away from it and I love it. I also bought the Vizio 2.1 soundbar so I'm not using the TV internal sound. I don't have very good eyesight though so anything big and inexpensive was a winner for me. I'd take this over a Magnavox or RCA or no-name brand based on my own experiences. Delivery service was good enough and this set is too big for UPS to destroy so the set arrived in great condition.	5.0	September 23, 2015
amazon.com	A great tv for the price. I bought a Vizio previously and it was quite dependable. The image is great, after some adjustments to your specific preferred settings. Your regular tv viewing, movies and video games will all look great with 1080p and 1080i images. The only thing I haven't tried out was the apps, I set up the wi-fi, but I have a Playstation 4, so I use that for Netflix, HBOGo, etc. Overall a great purchase.	5.0	September 23, 2015

amazon.com	Seems to be a good HDTV, with one exception in my case. . .the TV Wi-Fi has an extremely short range. I live in a 2-story home, and had my modem/router hooked up on the bottom floor (studio). I purchased this TV as a display (for upstairs) for my DVdeck as well as a HDTV for my grand daughters when they spend the night with us. Upstairs the Vizio 24&#34; would just not reliably keep the Wi-Fi connection. . .it kept dropping out, warning me about low bandwidth, etc., despite the fact that there were several other TV's, desktops, laptops, iPad, etc. in the near vicinity of the Vizio streaming with the Wi-Fi downstairs effortlessly. I finally had to move the modem/router upstairs right next to the Vizio, and now all is well, but from my experience I wouldn't purchase another Vizio for streaming movies (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.) unless is was certain my modem/router was within maybe 40 feet of the Vizio TV.	3.0	September 22, 2015

amazon.com	This is an initial review as I've only had the set for about 3 weeks. I'll evaluate further at a later date.  I don't use the wi-fi as I have a Roku 3 and a Blu Ray player.  Our normal viewing distance is about 10-12'.<br /><br />PICTURE: 5 stars<br />Extremely nice, crisp, bright picture with plenty of settings and flexibility.  Viewing angle is adversely affected at about 30 degrees off center but not significantly until you get to about 45 degrees.  No noticeable lag during sporting events, although there's some halo effect for dark scenes containing light objects. The pre-set picture profiles are exaggerated and cartoonish looking.<br /><br />REMOTE: 3 stars<br />Small and non-differentiated. Not very intuitive with small lettering and markings. Not easily usable if you have large hands. There's very little tactile differentiation between buttons and it's not back lit.<br /><br />MENUS:  3 stars<br />Menus are a bit confusing and counter intuitive. The information box (hit INFO button) is extremely small onscreen and virtually indecipherable from over 6'. The main menus I access are sound and picture and they're not easily usable.<br /><br />SOUND:  1 star<br />Awful sound reproduction which sounds distant- like there's a tinny echo.  For a capable flat screen LED with such wonderful visual capabilities, I shouldn't have to buy a sound bar for decent audio. Why can't TV's have adequate front-facing speakers and a slightly larger bottom bezel to accommodate them?  Hmm??<br /><br />SET:  4 stars<br />Handsome unit, light and unobtrusive.  Not a fan of the splayed feet but understand why they're preferable with larger televisions. Very stable and graceful looking.<br /><br />Overall an extremely well performing picture but failing sound and average menus and remotes.  Hence the 3 star rating...	3.0	September 21, 2015
amazon.com	This is an initial review as I've only had the set for about 3 weeks. I'll evaluate further at a later date.  I don't use the wi-fi as I have a Roku 3 and a Blu Ray player.

amazon.com	Great picture quality and very good audio quality. You need to mess around with the picture and especially the audio settings to get things right for u but this tv is great. It's massive and kinda overwhelming. It just barely fits on my table. My last tv was a dinky 19 inch Sansui tv that I bought at Walmart. This tv is almost like looking at a screen displayed from a projector. While I'm very happy with the audio I would definitely recommend some sort of surround sound system. And who doesn't have some sort of a surround sound system by now anyway? That said, the speakers are no where near as bad as some others on here make them out to be.<br /><br />Also very good for gamers. Menu text is very small on a 19 inch tv when using a ps4. :-)	5.0	September 21, 2015

amazon.com	The reviews I scoured before settling on this TV did not lie. It produces a beautiful picture with excellent contrast, impressive blacks (it features effective local dimming!), and perfectly good color (esp. once calibrated). Its refresh rate and motion blur are low, it interpolates well to 120 Hz if one desires it, and being a true 120 Hz panel it can output 24 Hz movies, 30 Hz NTSC content and 60 Hz video games all without duplicating or dropping frames, for flawless smoothness of presentation.<br /><br />I'm sure the built-in speakers are as awful as the reviews all state, but that is as-expected for modern TVs with their extreme flatness. It was heavy enough to be tough for one person to install, but still rather light for its size, which is large enough to give an excellent &#34;big screen&#34; feel.<br /><br />The &#34;smart&#34; features are perfectly usable, if not noticeably exceptional (I don't much use them due to cheap convenient superior alternatives). Though I was rather impressed that it supports GoogleCast (Chromecast) functionality for its apps, so for Netflix and Youtube at least you can use your phone/tablet/pc to queue up content directly.<br /><br />It's biggest weakness might be its somewhat high input latency, which is just barely noticeable for a somewhat sensitive person playing video games in normal picture modes. In its Game Mode however I cease to be aware of it, so most people (even ones very into games) should probably not let that discourage them (it worried me considerably when deciding, and I'm extremely glad I went ahead and got it anyway). Possibly if you're going through a receiver that adds more latency it could be an issue.<br /><br />Bottom Line: After having this a few months, I continue to believe it to be a great TV and an unrivaled value for its quality. Certainly there are alternatives that cost much more and offer some improvements (as well as pricier but still inferior options, I'll wager), but I suspect most people will be extremely happy with this option (including many enthusiasts, like myself).	5.0	September 20, 2015

amazon.com	I bought this item off of Amazon warehouse.  The description said: &#34;Condition: Used - Good - Item is in original packaging, but packaging may come damaged. Scratches on top or sides of item (less than 1&#34; x 1&#34;).&#34; However, the entire right side of TV is cracked, not scratched.  The frame is coming off screen about half way down.  The remote only works when TV is initially plugged in, but stops working after about 10 seconds. The TV is not functional and freezes before we can even do anything on it.  The TV also only turns off when unplugged. The condition of this product is not &#34;good&#34; if we can't even use it!	1.0	September 19, 2015
amazon.com	tl;dr- bad commodity television; avoid<br /><br />The picture is the definition of &#34;washed out&#34;.  No vibrancy to the colors, certainly not an exciting picture.<br /><br />After a month it locks up.  Can't change the volume, channel, input or settings.  Vizio says I have to pay for it to be sent to their warranty repair - a cost of over 100 dollars.  This TV now costs over 600 bucks plus the time wasted without it working.<br /><br />I don't care how good a product claims to be.  If the warranty support is not behind it- then good luck.  I'll never buy Vizio again, and I'll warn my friends/family.	1.0	September 19, 2015

Secondly, when you go to log into wifi that's set up like the one in my dorm, you will quickly find that YOU CAN'T.<br /><br />When you connect to wifi it simply allows you to access open networks OR only enter a password. My dorm requires me to also enter my username and then a password, and this is now allowed on this tv.<br /><br />To access a provided log in page, I need to open a browser window. That's when I come back to the original problem... THIS DOESN'T HAVE A BROWSER. HOW DO YOU HAVE A SMART TV WITHOUT A BROWSER?? IT DOESN'T EVEN OFFER A BROWSER AS AN APP.<br /><br />Apparently it also doesn't allow access to Firefox is you have a Fire TV Stick. &#62;:[<br /><br />SOOOO I paid the money for this tv and it's practically useless in regards to why I wanted it to begin with.

amazon.com	I initially bought a similarly priced Samsung 32&#34; 1080p Smart TV for the bedroom.<br /><br />We wanted a Smart TV for Netflix and Amazon without having to rent another cable box. The Samsung remote required several button presses at times to get an action. It also had a significant lag time from start up to being able to access the network. The lag time is similar to a 2010(ish) LG we have in the living room, if not even slower. It was painful for a $300+ TV so we ended up returning it and went to BB to play with their 32-40&#34; TV's.<br /><br />This Vizio stood out immediately on price. It loads the network quickly, the remote is easy to use, and the picture is just as good as the Samsung. It's no wonder to me why this TV has a 4.5 star rating here on Amazon. It was marginally more expensive than it's Samsung 32&#34; counterpart and leagues better in performance. Very happy with this TV.	5.0	September 14, 2015

amazon.com	I needed a TV for my office and bought this Vizio.  I took off a star because the picture doesn't seem very sharp, and it also seems dark despite adjusting brightness to full, which I have never come close to on any other TV set I have owned.  Still, for the price under $200, it does the job and I am pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />I have several old CRT TVs which still work great and it isn't hard to find people giving away their CRTs because even charities no longer accept them.  &#34;You can have it if you just come get it&#34;, so price was an issue with me because I could easily have gotten another CRT TV free and I think the picture quality exceeds many new TVs.  However I didn't want a TV to dominate my office,  and they are heavy and difficult to move without help. I wanted to be able to move it and it occurred to me that I could use a flat screen TV as an monitor as well, although I haven't tried to hook it up to a computer yet.  I found it easy to hook up, small enough so it doesn't dominate the room and easy to move from shelf to my desk.  I have clear reception via a small $15 antenna, and the smart TV features like Netflix/Hulu are easy to use and access.	4.0	September 13, 2015

amazon.com	This TV is a steal for the price. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the picture and the audio. I was looking for a moderate sized TV for my dorm room, mainly for gaming and Netflix. The smart TV feature of this is awesome and easy to operate. The setup is quick and easy. It's exactly what I was looking for and I am happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great picture quality for the size and price.<br />Light and easy to transport.<br />The Smart applications function very well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Connection between the remote and the TV while using an internet function can be unsteady. (I'm not sure if this is applicable to the wi-fi connection speed, but I've noticed on occasion while watching Netflix if I change the volume with the remote there will be a delayed response with the TV.<br /><br />DOES NOT come with an HDMI, just take note of that in case you were expecting one.<br /><br />There is no area on the back of the TV to secure it with a wall anchor cable or anything similar to that. You either need to use the feet it comes with on a flat surface or hang the TV with a wall mount. I was expecting somewhere I could anchor the TV in case it were to tip over, but that's not the case.<br /><br />There are no buttons on the set itself so everything has to be controlled with the remote.<br /><br />For video games, you will want to turn off the Clear Action setting on the refresh rate, otherwise you might have some odd stuttering of the picture.<br /><br />The set does not support 5.0 ghz band connection which ultimately means a slightly slower connection. However, this is subjective and all depends on the power of your internet itself. 2.4 ghz with a good upload and download speed, should result in no issues with streaming.<br /><br />Final conclusion: Great TV for a student living in a dorm or apartment, also would be great for a guest room. Just big enough to provide a nice view of the picture and the full HD picture quality is very nice. I highly recommend this TV, it's a bargain.	4.0	September 12, 2015

This is very disappointing.  My fault for not doing proper due diligence.<br /><br />Pleased with the picture, but the sound is not worth the cost of the TV.

Way better control during apps (Her old Tv, you couldn't filter prime videos on Amazon, and if you did, it just listed movies and you had to keep hitting a &#34;next button&#34;. No search option and if you searched, it would make you pay for the video even if Prime DID cover it). Everything works flawlessly. It's nice and big. The detail is superb. I hooked my Xbox One up to it and it looks AMAZING. She is super happy to have this TV and she enjoys it. I even like the new remote. But a I Love Heart Radio button? Really? Who's idea was that? Hold this L.<br /><br />Oh and they have SPOTIFY ON IT!	5.0	September 11, 2015

amazon.com	I have had this TV for a month now. The picture is very nice and I think very realistic. We watch a lot of tennis, golf and cycling and it is almost like being at the event. I did have to adjust the picture setting to get this result. Fortunately there are a ton of setting you can change. I had the Vizio and a Scepter tv from Walmart and decided on the Vizio. The pictures on both were good but it was like seeing a acrylic versus a watercolor painting. I preferred the watercolor. I did get a refurbished Vizio soundbar because we also watch a lot of British Shows and this helped with the dialog. I also got the 4 year service plan from Square Deal mainly for my own peace of mind. I feel like this is a very good value.	5.0	September 11, 2015

amazon.com	For the price, this is a great TV. We picked this up as a replacement TV for our bedroom. It looks nice and fits great in the space we had for it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great picture quality<br />Easy to use native apps (Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, etc)<br />Ability to add apps from Vizio app store using your remote<br /><br />Cons:<br />Terrible backlight bleed<br />Dinky remote<br />Hard to use remote in the dark<br />Sound is a little tinny<br /><br />I considered returning it after seeing the backlight bleed issues, but it really does not affect viewing quality much so I decided to hang onto it. We've been using it for a couple of months now and are really enjoying it. It is our first TV with native apps (no need for Roku, Chromecast), and we love having that built right in!	4.0	September 11, 2015

amazon.com	Wonderful for video, really impressive, but DO NOT BUY if you plan on trying to use it as a computer monitor too. I bought the 65&#34; thinking it would display chroma 4:4:4 based on the rtings.com review and spent a lot of wasted time trying to get it to work. RT got 4:4:4 working on the the 60&#34; version but this did NOT work for me with the 65&#34; and i tried everything, even getting a new video card. Nothing worked and i instead had to buy another set to use for a dedicated PC monitor.<br /><br />I've read a lot of people complain that the TV does a poor job on upconverting low res cable to 1080p and i have to agree. The TV itself does a poor job, but if i let the Tivo do the upscaling even lower res cable looks great. I liked this set so much for video i bought 55&#34; LG TV just for a computer monitor.. for the price i paid for both i do not think i could have gotten one single set that will handle each task as well as just having the two sets i bought. I did get an amazing price for both sets, and used some Amazon credit, otherwise this wouldnt have worked.	5.0	September 11, 2015

amazon.com	This is a great TV without a doubt, picture quality is very good especially after you tweak it a bit. A great feature is the audio digital out which delivers bitstream regardless of source so the receiver can decode whatever comes in. My [more expensive] Samsung cannot do this and delivers only PCM or DTS:Neo for the apps like Netflix etc.<br />Having the 2 feet make it more stable for such a big screen if you dont wall mount and the small frame looks really good. The remote is not the best with no backlight and squishy buttons but I used a Harmony universal remote anyway so no biggie for me. I got this for a family member and wish I had kept this one and given them the Samsung which says it all really.	4.0	September 10, 2015

Highly recommended for a child's smaller size room or dorm. her bedroom is about 10x12.	5.0	September 10, 2015
amazon.com	This is a great TV at the Amazon price.  I found this TV at store locations at a similar price but I had no way to take it home myself.  For about an extra $50, Amazon delivered the TV to my home in a 3 hour window within 2 days.  I was very happy with that service.  After mounting the 65in TV to the wall, about 5 hours into watching it, the TV screen went black.  I could hear sound, but there was nothing on the screen.  I originally called VIZIO for tech support and they told me that they were going to replace my TV and the delivery would be 7-10 business days.  I got tired of waiting and I contacted Amazon to see what they could do, and they agreed to replace my TV and would have another one to my house for a swap in 2 days!  I was very happy with the service that Amazon gave me for that.  I've had the TV now for about a 5 days and I like it a lot.  I highly recommend this TV if you want a large LED TV at a great price.  Hopefully my original TV was just a lemon.	4.0	September 10, 2015

amazon.com	I had to give this 3 stars out of 5 due to the fact that the first unit we received was defective/damaged.  Otherwise, this would be a 5 star review, as we love the replacement unit we received, especially considering the price.<br /><br />The first unit had severe light leaks at the corners of the screen (either defective or caused by damage during shipping).<br /><br />We ordered a replacement, and the replacement is fantastic so far.  There are no light leaks and all of the functions we've tried have worked perfectly.  We frequently use Netflix, which works great, we also use it to watch Blu-ray (via HDMI), Apple TV (via HDMI), and Cable via component.  There are some nice hidden functions that I didn't expect from an 'inexpensive' TV like the ability to name inputs, fairly advanced picture settings/modes, and even an equalizer for audio.<br /><br />I will say that the one area that this TV hasn't wow-ed us is in the audio department.  It just doesn't sound great, but we're using the TV speakers and I don't expect to get much out built-in TV speakers anyways.	3.0	September 8, 2015

There are many features that I haven't even explored yet on this TV - for instance my dog walked on the remote and we found iHeart radio - too cool - but I need to look in to that more.  The important thing to me is that I have a clear picture with good sound I and do.  The 32 inch screen gives me the big screen feel without taking over my room.	5.0	September 8, 2015

amazon.com	Depending on the light in the room, be prepared to spend a good amount of time adjusting the picture settings. I've had mine wall mounted for about 3 weeks now and I'm still making minor tweaks here and there. But over all, I'm really happy with the tv. I previously had a 50' vizio D-series, that touted a 120hz &#34;effective refresh rate&#34; and this 65&#34; E-series lists a 240hz &#34;effective refresh rate&#34;. If you do your research you'll know that's not the native refresh for either of these sets. This set has 120hz native refresh rate and it shows! The picture is really amazing. Action sequences are processed very well and come through very clear with fast action. The sound, really not so much. Very mid-range and tinny, barely noticeable bass tones. But there's no getting around that with these flat panels. So definitely plan on a sound bar or surround sound set up with this tv. I'm happy I went with the E65-c3. It's a really great picture. Very very satisfied.	5.0	September 6, 2015
amazon.com	Very pleased with this.  Does all I hoped it would. Vizio support efficiently assisted me with internet set up.

I was a little concerned because of some of the somewhat negative reviews I've read about the Vizio from other customers on this customer review, but let me reassure anyone considering this TV.  It has a beautiful picture, the sound is fine and I can go to Netfix directly at the push of a button!! It looks elegant in my TV cabinet, sleek and classy looking. I'm so happy I got this TV!!!

Then finally some text appears on a black screen saying it can't find a signal (I have netflix and no Cable) so I hit netflix or amazon buttons and it thinks some more before going to the site. It's a bit irksome because my other tv was instantaneous with this. Also, I am bothered that Pandora is not an option on this tv. There is a button for I Heart Radio which I just don't like as much as Pandora. Otherwise, the screen is nice and image is sharp.	3.0	September 2, 2015

amazon.com	Had this TV for about 3 weeks now and I will say that I am very satisfied. Few things about this TV that I want to point out:<br /><br />-This TV has an on button and that's it. No volume, no Channel buttons, so if/when you eventually lose the remote, you will be screwed atleast until you replace it. I've gone on 30 minute hunting trips for this remote especially when I move this TV to the room. The remote is pretty small and slick, which isnt really a complaint in itself, but for some reason it's really easy to lose.<br /><br />-This is a good TV if you are going to be moving it around, either transporting it between rooms, to someone else's house, etc. It's extremely lightweight, as noted by the UPS guy. When moving to the living room, it looks a bit small, like you could have gone up a size or two, but when moved to a bedroom it's a very good size. You could probably get away with a 40&#34; in the room, but it would not be as smooth for transporting, so if that's what you're going to be doing this is a very good choice.<br /><br />-I was not to keen on the feet of the television when ordering and would have much preffered a one stand base. Having owned it for 3 weeks now, I can say they are unexpectedly sturdy. If a having a base stand vs feet is a concern of yours like it was for me, I  can tell you it hasn't made much of a difference in my experience.<br /><br />-The speakers. The sound is the absolute bottom of the barrel, which is pretty much expected with most of all TVs with speakers on the back panel. However, remember what you're buying. This is a good budget TV for the the price but if you are an audio snob like me you will eventually have to buy a sound bar or some kind of speaker set.<br /><br />-The 1080p content is very crisp. The edge lit dimming looks somewhat odd if you are looking at it from the side(mostly on dark background). Almost thought my TV was busted the first time I noticed this. In this sense it kind of mimics a computer or laptop monitor. It looks completely fine when sitting in front.<br /><br />-Bought this TV for gaming and I must say this is probably the best aspect of the TV. All the game mode does is alter with the brightness, contrast etc settings, just like you can change to calibrated or vivid movies, and they even have have a computer setting.  The lag is very minimal on this TV in fact I can't say I've noticed any at all, making it exceptionally good for online gaming.<br /><br />-the Smart aspect of this TV leaves much to be desired. The apps, are very basic,  only ones of any real value being Netflix, Hulu plus and the Radio apps. There's is pretty much nothing there when it comes to apps and it doesn't look like they'll be adding more anytime soon. If you're buying it for this feature you'll probably have to invest in a Roku/chromecast/fire stick at some point if you want to get the most out of the &#34;Smart&#34; experience.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, although I was probably going to be satisfied in some fashion regardless since I am upgrading from an old CRT. I can't in good conscious give this review 5/5 because of the sound, but if that doesn't bother you very much or are planning to upgrade the sound or already have speakers, for $250 this is probably the best deal you're going to find honestly.	4.0	September 1, 2015

amazon.com	I just purchased this TV from Costco last night. If anything of substance changes, I'll take the time to post an update.<br /><br />Things worthy of note:<br />- It is much more convenient to be able to watch digital media directly on the TV than it is to have a Roku, Chromecast or Wii. It's easy and streamlined. I was hesitant about it using the Yahoo! Apps but it seems to be OK. Decent selection of apps. You do need to have Spotify Premium to use Spotify on this TV.<br />- My remote came with the three programmed buttons of Amazon Instant, Netflix and iHeartRadio. Obviously I would prefer them to be Netflix, Hulu Plus and HBOGo, but I suppose that you can't please everyone. It would have been nice if you can reprogram them to your desired channels.<br />- BIG CON: There is a buzzing noise that comes from our TV when it's on. It's quiet enough that you don't hear it when you're watching anything with sound, but when there isn't sound, it can be heard even from the other room. This might be a defect with my...

amazon.com	It has a great picture quality, especially for the price. I mean it really has amazing picture quality. The thing to keep in mind though, is the sound is terrible. I don't mean that its bad, I mean that I would rather turn the sound off of the TV and have none than use the sound that comes out of the built in speakers. Its a good thing I have a home theater setup and never have used the sound from the TV for more than a couple seconds. So really buy it for the picture, but find something else to generate your sound.	4.0	September 1, 2015
amazon.com	Bought the 65 inch about 2 weeks ago. The top part of the screen was slightly dented allowing sections of white glowing backlight to be visible. Amazon immediately sent me a new one and took away the old one- no questions asked. They assigned a customer service rep who called me daily to let me know of progress with the shipper and the installer (bought Dish installation for on wall mounting). The first delivery company screwed up with delivery scheduling and Dish did the same thing with the install date. For putting up with all of this crap Amazon gave me a credit. I am a lifelong Amazon Prime member. Can you imagine if every company you dealt with treated you with such respect? This is my 3rd Vizio- I have a 55 and a 60 that I bought 2 years ago.The TV is a terrific buy for the price. I am not a super finicky electronics consumer and I think the picture is great and there's a lot of flexibility to fine tune for your definition of accuracy. They have significantly upgraded the Amazon instant video interface from the older sets. The remote is flimsier than prior versions and doesn't have a keyboard on the back. This is a solid TV and I recommend it- a lot of screen for a little money.	5.0	September 1, 2015

amazon.com	Such a great TV! Works perfectly for gaming and as a monitor for my mac pro with a few adapters. The colors are very intense and it makes shows look almost too real. Only hiccup is that it toggles between wifi and ethernet a bit, but I haven't looked into the network settings to fix this yhet and it seems like that would be easy to fix. Five Stars!	5.0	September 1, 2015

amazon.com	This is yet another great TV from Visio. I already had several that I loved, so when I needed a new one for the bedroom, this filled the bill perfectly.  I connects to the internet through my wireless LAN, which is fast enough for direct streaming.  I have gigabit access, so I could always direct wire it if I ever needed more speed.  This does everything I want and more. The refresh rate is good, the picture is crisp and clear, and the blacks are very black.  I consider this TV a great bargain and would not hesitate to recommend it to any of my friends.	5.0	August 31, 2015
amazon.com	The only 24-inch TV I found that fits space under kitchen cabinet perfectly.  This was because the stand was just shorter than the others.

amazon.com	&#34;Smart TV&#34; does not mean that this monster can browse the internet.<br />If you want to browse the internet properly with this beast of a machine you need to buy ANOTHER ~$100 console box which was pretty annoying considering the high price tag.<br /><br />The color of this tv is nice though and the build in speakers are pretty good too. It is convenient that the remote has a Netflix button built into it as that is what I mostly use with this TV.	4.0	August 30, 2015
amazon.com	As a stand alone television, the picture quality is very good, it has a decent selection of picture modes (I personally keep it on gaming mode), the apps are not all that great because they are slow and such, but in a pinch are great in case you have to move it somewhere. The television is light weight in case you have to move it, it has mounting holes on the back which is good for couch enthusiasts, I don't really mind the reflective screen and glossy finish seeing as i hardly need to touch the television itself. The speakers are terrible, I suggest you buy some from a third party.<br /><br />As a computer monitor, it changes. The viewing angles up close are not that good, the edges disappear, the response time is a little bad for those into competitive shooters, but the picture quality is beautiful. Warning it may give you a headache the first day, but that will eventually go away. Discoloration is not very noticeable and when put on gaming mode, it makes it easier to look at for long periods of time.	3.0	August 30, 2015

amazon.com	Great TV for the money. CNET's recommendation led us to this model and we couldn't be happier. The picture quality is highly customizable, even setting multiple custom profiles. The sound is predictably poor, but who in their right mind wouldn't get at least a sound bar? (All the reviews decrying the sound as justification for a two star rating are bull anyways.) The smart TV apps work, nothing to write home about, but usable. They'll probably duplicate (be rendered obsolete) by any XBOX/Playstation/ChromeCast/AppleTV/FireStick/Roku device you have. But if you're not in the market to buy any of those things, then the smart TV apps are great.	5.0	August 30, 2015

Buttons are too small.  I'm one of those people that likes to be able to navigate the remote by feel and the remote is difficult.  Buttons are too low of a profile.

amazon.com	It worked out of the box and the picture quality was excellent. I selected this despite some very harsh negative reviews because it was the right size for a small TV in a spare bedroom. Setting up WiFi was a chore. Even though other devices could read my home wireless access point from this room, this TV struggled to find it. After repeated tries and much wasted time it finally connected and I launched Netflix to try it out. After a few minutes the connection was lost and could not be restored. Trying to play a DVD using the component connection worked for a while and then it just stopped. The set powered itself down and would not come back on with the remote or the single on-button on the back. The instructions for troubleshooting were limited and it was not worth the time and effort to try and make it work. It had only been out of the box for only a few hours when I called Amazon to return it. This was my first experience with Vizio and it was disappointing to say the least. I've ordered another Samsung TV that is a brand that I have used and trusted for years and would highly recommend over the Vizio.	1.0	August 28, 2015

I was hoping I would get points for the purchase but apparently not.  TV manuals (most manuals, actually) don't match the set or don't tell enough.  I am somewhat computer and electronics savvy but still would appreciate better and more complete directions..  I hope to be better satisfied as time goes by and expect I will be since most others who made this same purchase seem happy.	4.0	August 28, 2015

Every time I turn the volume up the brightness changes but goes back. Sometimes when you adjust the picture settings it doesnt save. For example if you put the black detail on low a day later it will change to high. I thought it was just the 43 inch E series smart TV I bought but it happened with the 43 inch D series and the 32 inch E series I bought. Other than that slight annoyance the TV is great and I recommend it.	4.0	August 28, 2015

The picture quality is excellent and rivals that of my more expensive Sharp Aquos.

If you are looking for a second TV in the bedroom or an office for watching TV shows and movies this is the perfect unit for you. I also purchased the 5 year warranty no reason not to with a TV. As a prime member I received the TV within 2 business days and shipping was free. If you don't have prime you are missing out! Once again great TV for the price!	5.0	August 28, 2015

Now the TV side is neat, the wifi is responsive, but I really use it mostly for designing and killing the crap out of digital creatures on destiny or something on the ps4...

amazon.com	I bought this before it was officially advertised. I currently only use it for Netflix/Amazon but so far have had few problems. The biggest problem i've had it that it will occasionally freeze up and the buttons and remote stop working. I have to unplug it to fix the problem. Not sure if there is a firmware update coming that will fix that, but I hope so. I also have a previous generation 49&#34; M series that I enjoy. This new E series is almost to the same quality picture. Happy with my purchase so far.	4.0	August 25, 2015

amazon.com	I've owned a Vizio 47&#34; TV for 3+ years and have had no problems at all.  I'd have to rate the 47&#34; 5 stars.  I just purchased this 40&#34; 2 weeks ago, so I'll be writing an updated review in a year or so.<br />  So far this 40&#34; model looks great, setup was quick and simple and I'm very satisfied with its picture quality.<br />  The only SIGNIFICANT disappointment is with the AUDIO design.  For some unfathomable reason Visio placed the speakers in the REAR of the TV!  HUH?  Now I'm shopping for a sound bar so I don't have to listen to the ridiculously placed rear-facing speakers.	4.0	August 24, 2015

amazon.com	This TV is not only the best I've used of the new 2015 models, but the specs it has for input lag, motion blur, and contrast ratio blow other TV's out the water. I purchased this model (E50-C2) from SamsClub/Walmart for about 480 without tax, which includes 90 days to return/exchange.<br /><br />My favorite features:<br />-Colors are accurate, punchy, and vibrant<br />-Backlight is very bright, resists a lot of reflections<br />-Netflix/Amazon buttons on remote, plenty of included applications<br />-Easy to navigate settings<br />-Wifi/LAN connections<br />-Multiple visual settings that control black levels, auto brightness, refresh rate (for each input)<br />-Automatic renaming of inputs, so instead of seeing HDMI 1 you would see &#34;Playstation 3&#34; or &#34;Cable Box&#34;<br /><br />I really don't want to have to name flaws, as they are minimal. but here are some:<br />-Gray colors can look dirty, but only on fully gray screens (like the boot screen)<br />-No motion interpolation (motion smoothing)<br />-240hz setting flickers too much<br />-Colors can be weird/choppy when used as a computer monitor<br /><br />Here are the specs that I went off: http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-brand/vizio/e-series-2015<br /><br />Overall, I can't think of a better price-per-inch TV with these specs for gaming.<br />If this TV lasts more than 2 years, It would suffice. Although I would hope it lasts for 4+ years.	5.0	August 24, 2015
amazon.com	Didn't buy the TV from Amazon but rather a large retailer for a better price.. Overall the TV is a good value, however be aware of two issues and one observation I discovered over the past two days of owning it.<br />1. Once you are connected to the internet, it can take up to a day for the TV to update it's firmware for a stable ability to download apps and content. Until that happens, the TV will tell you that you are not connected to the internet.<br />2. I have this TV hooked up to a Comcast DTA (analog) receiver in the bedroom for basic cable. Others have complained about the picture brightness fading in and out for no reason, I think it's a problem with the &#34;Auto backlight&#34; feature where the TV tries to adjust the picture contrast based on the video feed. Since I have a lower quality feed, I think this is causing very dramatic changes in contrast and brightness using this feature, however you can turn that feature off (Auto Backlight) in the &#34;Pictures&#34; menu (under more options). Ever since I turned that feature off the picture has been stable.<br />Observation: TV does not seem to have an &#34;auto brightness&#34; feature which will dim the screen in lower light conditions.. Not a showstopper however I do miss that feature from my old TV.	4.0	August 24, 2015
amazon.com	I wish I could give this product less than one star. DO NOT buy this &#34;product&#34; from Vizio. If youve read any of the other reviews on here, youll notice that a lot of people have the same problems with the tv. Unfortunately im no exception. The remote is unresponsive, the power button on the tv doesnt work, and if I try to use netflix at all, the Tv crashes. their tech support is a joke, and overall this was NOT worth the money. If any other device is connected at the same time as the tv, it wont work. Dont waste your money. please. Although face value this television looks nice, as soon as you connect to the internet it becomes a quick waste of space. Will  not be buying from vizio again. Really, not even being bitter. This just isnt a good piece of technology. Go for a Samsung. On top of all this, it doesnt even recognize the signal of my playstation.	1.0	August 24, 2015

There are pre-installed apps on the TV and only some which you have to pay for their use. The main input to watch anything on it is HDMI. And the TV connects wirelessly to the internet using your closest Wi-Fi source. So if you want a really good TV, get this one. Do not forget to get a Smart Guard Protection Plan. Highly recommended.	5.0	August 21, 2015

amazon.com	I bought this tv specifically for watching Netflix in by bedroom.  It had to be a smart tv because I don't have a cable box.  I can listen to stand up comedy and still get ready for work.  I really like this tv, but the first one I received stopped working after a few days.  I could tell it was turning on, but the screen was blank, I couldn't even get the menu to come up.  I called Amazon and they took me through few steps to reboot the tv and remote, nothing worked.  Amazon sent me a new tv in a couple of days and I returned the broken tv using the new box (since I had recycled the old box).  I didn't have to pay for shipping.  The new tv works great (I hope I didn't jinx it).  I know that sometimes the products I buy may turn out to be &#34;lemons&#34;, but Amazon stepped up and made me happy.  Thanks Amazon.

amazon.com	I was a bit disappointed in the Vizio E-50.  I have four Vizio TVs and have liked all but this last one. I feel the clarity of picture is not as good as our other Vizios. Also the base speaker seems to have an irritating cracking/vibrating noise at times. I would only give this product a 3 out of 5 recommendation.<br /><br />The cracking/vibrating noise is continuing and driving me nuts.....does someone know how to contact Visio to see if I can get a replacement???	3.0	August 20, 2015
amazon.com	I would give this 0 stars if possible.  I bought the TV and it worked great for 2 weeks before breaking.  The TV will only power on using the remote (the power button on the back doesn't work) but no other keys will work.  I can't change the input using the remote or the button on the back nor can I use any of the functions of the TV- it's essentially stuck on the current input.  Bear in mind this is after just 2 weeks of use.  I called Vizio support for a new TV and they agreed to ship a new TV out.  However, 20 days after the initial request, I have yet to receive the TV.  Vizio says they outsource the delivery and are no longer taking responsibility for the delivery.  I tracked the package using their number and it has been in my city for the past 10 days, but I've gotten no call for a delivery.  I've been calling Vizio all week and they keep saying &#34;call back in 24-48 hours for an update&#34; every time I call.<br /><br />Bottom Line- TV crapped out in 2 weeks and Vizio hasn't delivered a replacement.	1.0	August 20, 2015

amazon.com	Watch out, this TV doesn't work with a lot of WiFi networks due to being unable to enter a password greater than 22 characters.  The support solution of &#34;use a shorter password&#34; is ridiculous, and not always possible depending on your circumstances.<br /><br />There are some things you can do:<br /> - The TV supports WPS, so enable WPS on your access point/router momentarily.  This allows the TV connect and get the key without having to type it in the GUI.<br /> - Create a separate SSID for your TV, if you have an access point/router that can do this.<br /> - Plug directly in via Ethernet (if possible in your installation, this is the best option anyway)<br /> - Buy a WiFi bridge or AP that you can put into client mode and plug it into the Ethernet jack, letting the bridge communicate wirelessly.	2.0	August 20, 2015
amazon.com	So far this TV has been working great. No problem setting it up and it was mounted over the fireplace easily.

amazon.com	The TV has fantastic Picture Quality, Decent Sound and just the right size for a Small Bedroom to watch Movies, Play Video Games and more! It's a 'Smart TV', so it even comes with Apps and direct Wi-Fi Access! That's it for the good news. The down side is, for starters, there is an unexplainable lag in response between the time you click a button on the Remote and the TV responding to that click. It's very annoying, but if you're really patient, you can adjust to it. You shouldn't have to though, because no other TV has ever been that way from my experience. Also, after about 6 Weeks, the sound started popping in & out (While playing my PS3 via HDMI), but only when playing certain games, it seemed. It was so annoying, that I restarted my PS3 twice thinking that the problem was with either it or the HDMI Cable. Well.. I have to wonder no more. About 10 minutes ago, I was in the process of shutting down my PS3, because the TV started making a High-Pitched Whistling noise that I couldn't fathom the source nor cause of. I didn't know at the time whether it was my PS3 or the TV doing this, so I was shutting them both down one at a time to find out. Lo-And-Behold! It was the TV! How did I find this out? Because as soon as I stood next to it, I smelled and then saw Smoke billowing out of the back of it! 😱 Yes! 😳 Smoke! I unplugged it altogether, and the High-Pitched Whistling came to a screeching halt! (I don't know WHY my Smoke Detectors didn't start blasting, considering I can't boil water on the stove without them acting as though my home suddenly because a Towering Inferno!) Anyway, this beautifully designed, sturdily crafted, fantastic picture producing, decent (Virtual) Surround Sound making TV is a bust. Don't buy unless you're feeling lucky. &#34;Well... Do ya?... Punk?&#34; (Clint Eastwood reference) 😆&#60;-NOT! I wish I COULD laugh. Amazon can't help me now, so I'm gonna have to deal directly with Vizio.😕 Wish me luck..😢 I can feel the heartache of having to PAY to ship this damned thing off to somewhere in Bagdad to be repaired, already.😭<br /><br />I'd post a photo, but I'm sure you guys don't want to see a nice-looking TV midway into the process of crashing through my Bedroom window anyway, so... There's that. 😑<br /><br />[Update] Vizio has been a real dildo to deal with, but luckily, Amazon has come to my rescue! 😄<br /> I wrote to let Vizio know that their crappy 'customer service' is no longer needed. Amazon.com and their exceptional staff are taking back the TV and giving me a full refund. I've already told Vizio that I'm also going to write an in-depth review letting everyone know about the horrible performance issues (that I've tried to overlook, in favor of the decent picture quality), spontaneous combustion/billowing smoke incident AND the inconsistent, self-contradictory, counter-productive 'customer service' that followed. I'm doing so as a warning to anyone else who's EVEN CONSIDERING buying a Vizio product of ANY type, so save them from the horrid experience that I've had to endure, which ISN'T to be expected from a PROFESSIONAL place of business. I'm simply appalled. The TV was smoking like a small incinerator and after being told by Vizio that they were going to get my TV fixed and/or replaced, I'm suddenly given the MIDDLE FINGER??!! 😠😡😤	1.0	August 19, 2015

amazon.com	I just received my Vizio yesterday.  The product was delivered on time and in excellent condition though it was delivered via the USPS.  The set up was extremely easy but it was a little tricky for me because I needed coaxial cables (that I did not have but have placed an order for) to hook up a fairly old DVD player (If it ain't broke why replace it...LOL). So for now, I used the audio/video cables that I had.  Nonetheless, setting up the internet/wifi connection was easy because the tv found my network.  I would say, that I am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a great Smart LED HDTV at a great price.	5.0	August 18, 2015

This remote is almost the best I've ever used. Lots of inputs and processor is extremely fast. I've never lost a wi fi signal for the smart tv and it's the fastest buffer I've seen besides my laptop computer. Assembles the stands in seconds, (Besides plugging in the power chords and putting batteries in remote it's all it needed). One Philips screw driver 4 screws and 5 minutes at most it was ready to set up. Registration and set up is an ease and took maybe 5 mins. I have the same TV only LCD a year older. It's way more difficult and confusing to operate. I wish I bought a larger one.	5.0	August 17, 2015

amazon.com	***DO NOT BUY THIS TV!***<br />As other people have noted, this TV set 'pulses' in brightness, going from bright to very dim and back again, every 5 to 20 seconds; it's variable. IT MAKES THE TV  ***COMPLETELY UNWATCHABLE***. Sometimes it goes very dim, and stays that way for several minutes. So you adjust the brightness to near maximum, only to have it suddenly start to get brighter and brighter and brighter again. Vizio 'tech support' was absolutely worthless. They wanted me to ship the brand new TV at MY EXPENSE to them for 'repair'.<br /><br />ALSO: the picture on 480 SD (standard definition) is just HORRIBLE. It's like every program is badly out of focus. I couldn't read the credits after a movie.  I have an older 19&#34; Vizio and the picture is really nice, so it's NOT my cable feed. This is just a BAD TV SET.<br /><br />This is a total piece of Chinese JUNK, and it's going back to Amazon tomorrow. What an incredible waste of my time, ordering it, waiting for a WEEK to get it, spending all the time to set it up. Now I have to package it it up and ship this piece of Chinese crap back to Amazon.<br /><br />DO ***NOT*** WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!	2.0	May 1, 2015

I turned that OFF,  it was annoying with the brightness fluctuation,  I just set the backlit & brightness & contrast to my custom settings.  Also can't get the headphone jack to work.  But other than that, its a marvel of modern engineering.	4.0	August 10, 2015

amazon.com	Our LG tv went poof while we were watching the news and while it was under an extended warranty, the wait time for a tech was a couple of weeks. We went in search of a replacement and figured we'd put the repaired TV in the bedroom. Shopping for a TV is a difficult thing to do. One review says it's wonderful, another says stay away. We read about light leaks, bleeding color, bad black colors and all these things that in the old days no one had to think about. My parents just chose a screen size and came home with the TV. It's all very complicated now. All we wanted was a 50 inch TV that would give us a good picture and did not break the bank. After reading a lot of reviews, we chose this one because it was inexpensive and opinions were generally very good.<br /><br />It arrived in an outer box filled with packing materials that were triangular shaped pieces of cardboard. After we took the TV out of the large, outer box, our cat ran in there and treated it like a bounce house kicking and jumping all over the pieces. I was able to easily lift the TV, put it on the entertainment center and connect everything. We changed the display to Dynamic (I think) and made a few adjustments to individual settings and are very pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind: Many TVs have the stand in the center so are only limited by the size of your entertainment center. What I mean is, if you have a 40 inch wide object with a 20 inch stand in the center, you could get away with putting it on a 24 inch tabletop because the entire stand would be accommodated. This television has the feet on the extreme edges so make sure you measure the width of your TV stand before ordering to ensure it fits.	5.0	August 10, 2015

amazon.com	The delivery: I purchased it on Wednesday using Prime -expecting it on Friday- instead wasn't delivered until Wednesday (Tuesday first attempt).<br /><br />The packaging: The box showed the usual amount of wear that you'd expect - Corners rounded, some sides badly scraped. But I was displeased to find two corners of styrofoams badly damaged to the point where I began to wonder what kind of damage the TV might've incurred during shipping.<br /><br />The packaging II: The screen panel on lower right side had multiple, noticeable scratches. This infuriated me. The panel is the end result of what's inside the TV. No matter how late and superior technology the TV utilizes, if panel is damaged then it's a fail.<br /><br />The performance: This is my first time buying a HDTV that wasn't Samsung or LG. The price to performance ratio may be comparable to former. But Vizio -at least the one I received- is not up to par with them when it comes to performance. It's just not as clear nor brilliant no matter how much I manipulated the settings.<br /><br />The ease of use & innovative feel: There aren't any. The remote is too simplified to have full control of smart TV functions. It even disappoints watching regular on-air television. This TV doesn't offer TV listings like my previous ones did. The only way to know what's on where is to tune-in to each channel and clicking info.<br /><br />Overall, I'm content with what I got, not overly excited nor upset. This was to complete my mini man-cave, and it definitely served that purpose at a reasonable price. I'll also be replacing my current living room TV soon with a 70&#34; 4K TV. It just won't be a Vizio.	3.0	August 9, 2015

amazon.com	I did not buy my first Vizio smart TV from Amazon mainly because I caught a great deal from a large box store.  However when the new &#34;Black Friday&#34; came about I ran to Amazon to find smart TVs for bedrooms.  These are perfect. Great size for a bedroom, great connectivity to the internet that leads to Amazon Prime. Extremely easy to set up even for this Luddite.  Vizio TVs are the best as far as I am concerned and Amazon hit the ball out of the park with the price.  Bought 2, wish I had bought 4.	5.0	August 8, 2015
amazon.com	I have owned many Vizio products over the years, and have usually been satisfied with their products. This TV is a piece of junk. I ordered it on 7/3/15 and it shipped Prime. I installed it as a replacement to the 17&#34; LCD in our RV, as the outside dimensions are about the same as the old one, but would give us 7 more inches of screen diagonally. Powered up, scanned the channels, and the picture popped up and looked great - for a moment anyway. Right away the remote would work intermittently, but mostly did not work at all. Then, the screen started to intermittently dim, darkening the picture just enough to be annoying. The power button on the TV also did not work. It did, however, connect to the WiFi right away. After a few very annoying days, I called Amazon and they immediately refunded me and sent a return label. I had to go out of town the next day for a month, so my wife sent it back. Amazon sent the new one on 7/12/15, it arrived on the 14th, and it sat there until I returned home today (just shy of a month). I installed it and guess what - SAME EXACT ISSUES and more. This time, the audio did not work. Settings were good, but nothing. Also, it would not display any WiFi networks (there are at least 15 within range of any device in my RV. I do not know how this has achieved a 4.2 star rating. I had two bad ones in a row with multiple identical issues.The aggravation has been the worst part of it. I spend a lot of money on tech products. This have been very disappointing and I will now think twice about buying Vizio products in the future. Amazon customer service, as always, has been super. Vizio support was a joke.	1.0	August 8, 2015

I will buy another VIZIO only much larger . . .32&#34; -  42&#34; for the room.	3.0	August 8, 2015

amazon.com	Received the tv, and to be honest, it took longer to get it out of the box than to get it set up and connected to my wifi.  It has great picture quality.  I have it in a relatively smaller living room area and it is approximately 8-10 feet from the couch.  I have not noticed any distinct color or tone loss from any angle I can view the TV from in my room.  The ONLY reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because there is no internet browsing capability on the TV, at least none that I could find.  I was easily able to install and set up my Plex media server, thus allowing me to stream any and all of the media I have on my PC.  I currently have it hooked up to an analog coaxial TV input, and even with that low end video connection, the picture looks great.  I may update once I have a HD input hooked up.	4.0	August 8, 2015
amazon.com	Although the interface is user friendly and there are many great features on this TV, the TV itself is awful.<br />Afte about three months of use the remote is only registered by the TV about 30% of the time so I have to unplug the TV or give up on watching anything, the TV freezes A LOT, the sound is AWFUL (when my A/C is on I have to have to volume on 100% and can still hardly hear it), and the quality for the money is just not worth it.	2.0	August 7, 2015
amazon.com	I bought this TV for my travel trailer.  Trying it out in my office before I pick up the trailer and so far so good.  I'm surprised at the speed of the smart TV features.  Not as fast as Roku 3, but close enough and eons better than my 2012 phillips &#34;smart&#34; TV.  I'm still going to put Chromecast and AppleTV on both of the HDMI ports as well as utilize OTA, but I will likely utilize the Netflix and Amazon Prime video on the smart TV when I want to watch something on those services.  The picture is great and responsive - especially for the low price.  The remote feels a bit cheap compared to other remotes, but its small size and low weight are growing on me.  It is very functional and intuitive.<br /><br />Time will tell if this TV will hold up like my 2006 Sony HDTV has. Giving it 4 out of 5 and will report back over time.	4.0	August 7, 2015

amazon.com	The TV is very good-looking, nice thin bezel, easy to assemble, and very light. Picture quality is definitely sufficient for the price, and I haven't even had time to tweak it manually yet. My first issue is minor, and it is that it does not support a 5.0GHz wireless band, which is what I like to use for my streaming devices.<br /><br />Second though, was that upon selecting picture presets, the back of the TV(not the speakers) started to hum depending on the setting. After playing with it, it appears that the Auto Brightness Control setting is causing the hum to get louder or change tone. Only the Vivid and Computer setting would not hum, and the Auto Brightness Control is set to OFF in those settings, but in all of the others, it is set to low, med, or hi, and the hum becomes louder the higher you get. Turning ON the Auto Brightness Control on Vivid or Computer mode will cause it to start humming again, and weirdly, turning it OFF on the other presets causes it to hum the loudest, no rhyme ...

amazon.com	If you're looking to buy a gaming tv or a monitor this product might not be the best one for you. This TV is very high quality and vizio makes amazing TVs, but I feel that with this one they just didn't spend enough time on it.<br />Pros: High Quality<br />  Good Looking Design<br />  Smart Tv<br />Cons: Screen Is To Bright And It Can't Be Changed<br />  The Smart TV Aspect Is Slow<br />  Sounds Goes Up And Down<br />  Brightness Goes Up And Down<br /><br />I Use It As A Second Monitor, Might Just Be A Faulty TV But Make Sure You Do Your Research.

amazon.com	Great tv and great picture.  Bought this one as a house-warming gift for my kid.  The built in apps allow my daughter to use her Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, and Netflix accounts without having to buy a fire-tv or a google stick. You can always add a fire-tv or stick later if you want. Great buy.	5.0	August 7, 2015

amazon.com	I ordered this TV because my previous one had *way* too much input delay for playing games, and the &#34;games&#34; specific mode didn't help at all.  This solved the problem nicely - I don't notice the input delay/input lag at all when playing games.  Netflix/other support is just a bonus.	5.0	August 6, 2015

amazon.com	I purchased this item specifically because I stream a lot of programming over Net Flix and Amazon and the size is perfect for the space in my home office.  The streamed programs buffered too frequently to make viewing enjoyable.  I do not have a problem streaming content on my computer, iPhone or Kindle.  I concluded the problem was with the TV.  I contacted Vizio support via live chat, went through a total reset of the tv as instructed.  I was then  kicked off the live chat because I was evidently on with the technician too long as he said he would have to end the chat session after 3-5 minutes even though I was having work my way through a total reset up process.  The problem was not resolved, and I could not get the screen size to readjust on regular broadcast programs.  I believe I will constantly have problems with this  TV and have decided to return it.  I guess you get what you pay for.	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	Unfortunately, my tv arrived with the screen completely damaged, smashed in somewhere during shipping. When I called Amazon Customer Service, they offered to replace the TV at no cost to me, and have the new TV overnighted. The second TV was WELL PROTECTED inside of another huge box with padding and wrap. When I opened it I was happy to find that it was in excellent condition. It installed and setup super easy. Remote is nice, but I will soon upgrade to the remote with the full keyboard on the back. My USB wireless keyboard works fine for letters, but it does't seem to like me typing numbers. Picture quality looks excellent, and the sound, although it doesn't get cinema loud, sounds as though it has nice depth and clarity.<br /><br />Apps are limited. HBO GO is not available so I suggest owning another &#34;smart&#34; device such as Roku, AppleTV, or a gaming console with more app choices.	5.0	August 6, 2015
amazon.com	Just bought this yesterday to replace an  year old Sony Bravia.  Easy set up for TV and Wireless.  Great Picture.  Turn on the TV and the Stereo comes on as well with the remote controlling the stereo sound.  Wonderful!  However I am EXTREMELY dissapointed that you cannnot label the TV channels nor is there a &#34;favorite channel&#34; feature.  When there are so many channels one now has to memorize the channel number rather than go to a favorite list.  My 8 year old Sony had this.  This is an easy feature and may be a deal killer for me.	4.0	August 6, 2015

amazon.com	This TV worked great, for 2 days. Then it just started freezing after you start it and try to execute any menu commands. I called customer service (Vizio) and the troubleshooting steps verified that it was defective. No repairs or replacement options are available for this model, so they've told me I have to send them pictures proving the TV freezes (aren't all pictures frozen?) along with proof of purchase and they'll let me know what's next. I'll update the post once I learn more.<br /><br />My primary mistake: I tossed the box to the TV after a couple of days of it working. If I hadn't, maybe I could have just returned it through the more friendly Amazon method :(<br /><br />**Update: After awaiting a promised call from Vizio that never came, i contacted them and they instructed me to mail them the TV back for a refund . No prepaid shipping or anything. I decided to call Amazon and they were brilliant. Replaced the TV and provided return labels for the busted one!<br /><br />My replacement hasn't had any issues. I suspect that my original froze when I connected it to my PC via the Plex app to use it as a media server. I didn't set that up on my  replacement TV and haven't had any issues. That may not have been the cause, but I thought I'd share in case it helps anyone.	1.0	August 5, 2015

amazon.com	I purchased this television to replace a really old 32&#34; 720p LG screen I purchased when flatscreens first came out.  I used to have my desktop hooked up to the screen so I could watch all of my favorite Amazon shows and movies from the desktop.  One of the features I really liked about this television was the built in access to Amazon and Netflix.  My roommates have a smart tv elsewhere in the house, so I already knew this was going to be useful.  I rarely ever have to turn my computer on to watch anything any more.  I hung this television on the wall across from my bed, so I sit about 14 feet away from the television.<br /><br />I am not an expert on audio/visual equipment.  I have a 10 year old 5 disc CD changer that I use for a sound system, which means I really can't tell you how good the speakers sound.  I can say that I think this TV looks fantastic, but that may be because it's bigger and better than what I replaced it with.  It was very easy to set up all of my accounts, and the remote is easy to navigate.  It was also easy to plug in all of my various accessories.  For the price, it is an excellent buy.	5.0	August 5, 2015

Beautiful display and nice thin bezel for a modern look.<br /><br />My only issue when I bought it was that it stands on two leg stands at each end, instead of one in the middle. I had to get a new piece of furniture to hold it so keep that in mind when purchasing.	4.0	August 4, 2015
amazon.com	Came on time, no damage, works great.<br />Using it as a workstation monitor with some gaming - works just as well as a monitor for a fraction of the cost for both.<br />This is my second Vizio smart TV's, never had an issue with either.	5.0	August 4, 2015
amazon.com	The picture so far is great. Knocked off a star because some of the buttons on the remote make clicking noises (it's 2015, why are there still clicks?) and the app selection is limited. Would love to see hbogo on there. Set up was a breeze, I don't have cable, and only wifi in my room. Connection is great, streaming Netflix now and the picture is better than I expected. Fantastic price for a smart tv, as I didn't want to spend extra $ on chromecast and all those extra dongles, it really couldn't be beat.	4.0	August 4, 2015
amazon.com	I have been more than pleased with this television.  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.  I would also recommend the purchase of a sound bar with it (the speakers are rear facing).

amazon.com	My Wife bought this TV for me on father's day. I've played with it enough...here's my 2 cents...<br /><br />I downgraded my 55' Sony HX750 to the bedroom for it. The VIZIO outperforms the SONY with deeper blacks giving the scenes much more pop and a more realistic feel. I mounted mine so there is never a bad viewing angle. (see pic)<br /><br />I had my doubts getting a VIZIO to begin with. I have a 50' Samsung Plasma when they still cost $3k and the Sony HX750 set me back around 2k. For 900 bucks at Costco and a 2 year warranty, it's worth 5 stars for value.<br /><br />The unit has multitude calibration settings, I use CNET's recommendation and have pretty much left it alone. My biggest disappointment is the skin tones. Is it a deal breaker, nope. On BluRay, I don't see an issue, but on day to day usage, Amazon Prime, or movies from DirecTV, the skin tones have too much punch lacking refinement of faces, nose, etc...it is what it is. This is where my HX750 wins and so does my 7 year old Samsung Plasma. The HX750 gives you excellent skin tones, wrinkles, etc as does the Samsung...The VIZIO gives you a blotch and nothing more. BUT the black production sure is beautiful and watching a movie in pitch black is great! This is where the HX750 lags drastically and even though the Samsung Plasma produces the deepest blacks, it also gets really hot and warms up the room.<br /><br />For value, the TV is worth 5 stars, but for picture quality, it's a good 4. VIZIO takes the playbook from other top end TV manufacturers and puts their own twist, called AFFORDABILITY! To have everything you &#34;want&#34; from a TV, you will have to pay for it, and I'm not in a financially position to drop another 3-4k on a TV. I am very much pleased with the TV.<br /><br />I had my doubts about VIZIO for so many years, but I think with Technology advancing the way it has been recently. I might have just jumped on the VIZIO bandwagon. My next TV will a 70' 4k, but with 4k still in it's toddler stage, why should I invest in it yet? So I'm very happy with a 1080P unit for at least 2 years before moving on up.<br /><br />For those on the fence, jump over, you won't regret it. You will not find a better performing TV in this price range, even up to 1,800.00 range. So save the money, buy 2 32' in VIZIOs and place them in your children's room because that's what my wife did for less than 1,600.00.	4.0	August 4, 2015

amazon.com	I bought this TV for the guest bed room from a local club warehouse. I've always heard great things about VIZIO so I decided to give them a shot. Initially, the TV worked well for my guest the first evening it was set up. The very next morning, the TV was unable to detect any wireless access points. This was rather embarrassing as I bragged about getting the TV especially for them. After an hour with their award winning customer service, they concluded that the TV was faulty and needed repair. That is to say, in less than 24 hrs, the TV broke. They requested I send it in for service but I declined in order to return it since it had been only 24 hours since I bought the TV. I wish my experience with VIZIO was more positive and understand that my problem is likely an isolated incident, but nonetheless, my first and last experience with VIZIO was very poor.	1.0	August 3, 2015

amazon.com	This is the best TV I've ever owned. So many times these types of TVs' have the worst sound. That's not the case here. My last television had to be hooked up to my stereo all the time (its sound was like a transistor radio). This TV sounds great with the built in speakers. When hooked up to the stereo it sounds even better (and seems to have a powerful output). And of course the picture is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone like me who has limited funds and wants a good television. Well worth the price.	5.0	August 3, 2015
amazon.com	I great TV for me for the price.  I just figured out after I bought the TV how they do TV measurements!  I always thought it was measured length of the TV, but it's the diagonal length!

amazon.com	I needed to finally join the decade and get rid of my very fat back TV and buy a flat screen.. but I am a young person without very much money. This was the best TV in this price range.<br /><br />The video is good and the TV looks sleek. The sound isn't very good though, so now I am saving up for a sound bar so I can actually hear my TV every time. The size is perfect for my tiny studio apartment.<br /><br />The remote is super small and flimsy and doesn't light up. I am not sure valuable remote space is wasted on a button dedicated to &#34;iHeart Radio&#34;... who uses that? If a radio type app gets a button then it should be Pandora or Spotify. Sometimes it doesn't connect to my wifi too well but I also have the cheapest wifi I could get so that could very well be my fault.<br /><br />All said, buy it if you can't afford any better, it will do you good!	4.0	August 1, 2015

They actually worked around my schedule, brought the box into the house, unpacked it, set it up and made sure everything worked before they left. I did not have to do much to the TV after setting up the cable top box, the picture is clean and crisp. I purchased a vizio soundbar for this TV and I definitely suggest doing the same as the sound on the TV was pretty bad, I have yet to play with the optimal settings, but it's cool to have the netflix and amazon button on the remote. I really wanted the 70', but it wouldn't fit, I was a little hesitant with Vizio, but they have exceeded my expectations!	5.0	July 31, 2015

amazon.com	I Have had this VIZIO E32-C1 32-Inch 1080p Smart LED HDTV for about a week. This TV replaces 2 new Sharp LC-32LE653U 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz Smart LED TV that I purchased with in the last 2 weeks, these 2 had a lot of problems, so I decided not to get a third one. I  Was talking with the representative from amazon and he recommended the Vizio TV! Great Choice. this one is a lot better than the sharp. great picture good sound for a small TV. set up was a breeze, about 10 minutes including wireless net. The only con that I have is the remote is a little small and there are only 2 HDMI inputs. Other than that it is a really nice TV for a 32inch.	4.0	July 28, 2015

amazon.com	I love the look of this TV with its small bezel and barely noticeable stand. The sound is fine to me. Adjusting the picture is very easy and there are tons of settings with a lot of choices. The internet hookup is a breeze and very intuitive.<br /><br />However, after many attempts, even with the advice from online TV bloggers, I just couldn't get a satisfactory picture. It would change too drastically between channels. I would finally be happy with the screen for a movie and then switch to CNN and have to start the adjustments all over.  Also the viewing angle is extremely poor. When I moved from the chair in front of the TV to the couch, some four feet away, the picture became faded with washed out colors. Even just standing instead of sitting in front of the TV made the colors look lighter.	2.0	May 1, 2015
amazon.com	Got the 24&#34; TV for kitchen. Mostly interested in the Netflix apps and DLNA for media. The TV functions just fine for what it is and Netflix is great. The only thing that don't work properly is DLNA. It does not play lots of formats like .mp4 as an example. The DLNA issue is a problem for all my friends with Vizio also and its a known for Vizio apparently. The movie files will work fine on the USB stick connected directly to TV, but just not through DLNA on Vizio. To me, I  don't care what the issue is or what the workaround is ... but if it supports DLNA , it needs to just work. It works fine on all my Samsung TV. Don't get Vizio if you use DLNA, you will be disappointed.	4.0	July 27, 2015

I have a seperate sound system so the lackluster sound doesn't apply to me which I knew about going in, thanks to CNET. I did not expect white glove delivery included but got it! They hooked everything up and all I had to do was register the product by following the easy on screen step by step instructions and then connect it to the internet. Again, step by step instructions. All in all I couldn't be more pleased and I got an extra $50 of for being a Prime member too! Thanks Amazon..	5.0	July 26, 2015
amazon.com	for the money, vizio e-series tvs are the best bang for the buck. simple.  pull yourself back from the cliff, save your money, and simply buy the best bang for the buck.  you will  be happy you did.  (note:  unless you are a videophile or sitting close to the TV, UHD is a waste of money... at least for the next couple of years.  wait.)<br /><br />==========by the way=================================<br />why are so many reviews on this site and for this tv for other model numbers--- or worse--- years?????  the critical reviews for this model (e70, 2015) are almost all from prior year and smaller (completely different components and tech).  Plus, many of the reviews are from out of warranty issues.  how can anyone be out of warranty... unless they chose (foolishly) not to buy an extended warranty.  these are tvs... they break... extended warranties get you a repair or new one.<br /><br />anyway, PLEASE only write reviews for the actual item you are reviewing.  otherwise, those of us trying to discern which brand, model, and year are forced to sift through your unrelated non-sense.  nobody has that kind of time.<br /><br />thank you.	5.0	July 26, 2015

amazon.com	This TV is not actually 120 Hz as stated.  Vizio just used fancy wording to make consumers think it is.  My problem is, I have a stereo 3D system I wanted to use on this TV.  It takes 120 Hz for this to work.  Imagine my surprise when it didn't work.  After going through all the specs, I finally found it was actually a 60 Hz TV.  I contacted Vizios customer service to see if there was a way to change it, and they gave me the run around calling it &#34;SPS refresh rate&#34; which basically means the LED backlighting is scanning at 120 but the TV is actually refreshing at 60.  I'm sure most people don't really care because they don't need a TV that is actually 120Hz, but I did, and was very disappointed.  Other than that, the TV looks ok so far.	2.0	July 25, 2015

I have another Vizio in my living room which has been great. I like how easy set up is on these tvs and the picture is good. The sound on this tv is actually better than l expected thanks to the front facing speaker. I have a sound bar set up for the one in my living room because sound was lacking on that. So this is a nice feature for this 24 inch as l have it mounted in my bedroom with no real space for a sound bar. The size is perfect for a bedroom, dorm room, or probably an RV. Well worth the price!	5.0	July 25, 2015
amazon.com	I am returning this TV next chance I get. Unsure as to if its a manufacturing defect or something they could fix with a firmware update but the WiFi is completely worthless. I have a 30-50mbps connection at any given time which is more than capable to stream things on several devices simultaneously. This thing just does not play nice with others.<br /><br />I'm sitting here writing this review with the TV no more than 15' from my router and the only 2 devices on wifi are my phone writing this review and the TV. The network tests fine, full 5 bars, but launch any app and it either gives up after 1 minute or if you do connect it fails trying to buffer the media and crashes. The only way to get it back connected is to turn the TV off and back on.<br /><br />Other than that it is a very decent TV for the money. If you plan on using a computer or other streaming device I'm sure you will be more than thrilled with the picture quality, size weight and ports on the TV.	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	Ordered this online and paid to have the unit professionally mounted. Delivery service included bringing the box inside unpacking it, plugging it in, and verifying that everything was in good order. Delivery guys were very helpful,  prompt, and courteous. Be aware that when you order a larger size TV you may also need a new router or additional hardware. Also,  arrange for cable service appointment. This is my second Vizio television very happy with the quality picture. Some folks do prefer adding a sound bar or other  speakers, which I agree could be helpful. However, the picture and smart apps are wonderful and I couldn't be happier. By the way, if you are wondering whether you  would feel overwhelmed by a 65 inch television screen let me assure you that it takes about five minutes to get used to it! I love my big screen Visio.	5.0	July 24, 2015

amazon.com	I purchased this TV at Walmart recently.  I have a 50&#34; Panasonic Viera in my living room and I personally enjoy the Vizio much more.  For starters my Panasonic Viera does not have a built in wireless adapter so I either have to run a cable or buy an external adapter to use the smart menu.  The only thing I can get to function on my Panasonic smart menu is Netflix but the menu for Vizio is by far better and everything functions.  The remote for this is small but no big deal, it has everything you need to operate the tv and it has a few buttons that will take you directly to the smart tv app you want.  Those buttons are Amazon, Netflix, and IHeart Radio.  Very easy to set up and there's even enough space to fit a DVD player under the TV once the legs are attached.	2.0	May 1, 2015

Her only negative comment was that the screen reflects light so she closes her blinds when the bright outside light hits the screen.  We were overjoyed when she was able to upgrade from her older 33&#34; Samsung with a large bezel to this 40&#34; with a smaller bezel.  In her TV cabinet, we had 1/2&#34; extra width on the sides!

On normal or warm setting it looks like their is a filter on it. Computer is more accurate, and cool is cool. But overall no matter what I adjust even using software the color is always slightly off. So if you want to buy a tv that is great right out of the box without having to spend hours  or a lot of money trying to get it calibrated and looking good buy something else.	3.0	July 22, 2015

amazon.com	I own two 50 inch Vizio Tvs. My first purchase was the 4k TV. I purchased this led TV for my upstairs and thought I'd save a little. Honestly there is a large difference. It's worth spending a little extra money and going for the 4k. However if you can't swing a 4k it's not a bad TV. You notice the pixels a bit and its not as bright as some LEDs.

amazon.com	When the TV went out in our bedroom, I looked for another 32&#34;LG TV, since we've had such good luck with them.  I saw this Smart TV at a great price, so I thought I'd try VIZIO.  The set up of the TV and remote was an absolute snap.  The picture is exceptional!  However, I still haven't been able to get the &#34;Smart&#34; (wifi) part of the TV to work.  I'm pretty tech savvy, and with a bit of perseverance and google, I can usually figure most things out.  I spent and hour and a half on the internet trying to figure out why this wouldn't connect.  I did all the online tutorials and even went to You Tube.  I called customer service.  No wait and got a really great representative, Carolyn.  She worked with me for over an hour and still no connection.  I'm going to try one more suggestion that was in these reviews and if that doesn't do it, I'm returning it for a &#34;Non&#34; smart TV.  It looks like I'm not the only one who had a VIZIO who wouldn't connect to the Wifi and for the hassle, I don't need the access on this TV.	3.0	July 22, 2015

amazon.com	It's everything we hoped it would be.  The picture is bright and sharp, and the video settings are good, right out of the box.  Setup took a matter of minutes.<br /><br />This TV replaces an old DLP rear-projection set.  Because it had no HDMI input, we had to drive it using component cables, so it was running in 480p.  Also, the picture was so dim, we had to turn off all the lights in the room to watch it.  Relplacement bulbs cost $300, and needed to be replaced every six months.<br /><br />So it won't surprise you to hear that we are completely blown away by the difference.  No more dim room lights!  This one is quute literally dazzling.<br /><br />The built-in WiFi ain't too shabby either.  We've set aside enough Netflix movies to last us into 2016! ;-)	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	I've had this television for about a week now, and all in all, it's definitely a worthwhile purchase. But with all its pros come some cons. So let's break this package down, and take a look at why you should buy this TV if you're in the market for a thirty-two-inch, and why you should be prepared to not completely love it.<br /><br />First, the pros--<br /><br />1. This television's wireless. No Roku, no Chromecast, no Fire TV needed. You just open up the settings, find your network, plug in your password, and...voila. You're ready to be disappointed by the latest season of Orange is the New Black.<br /><br />2. This television has a native refresh rate of one-hundred-twenty hertz, with a simulated refresh of--I think--two-forty.That's not something you see in a lot of thirty-two inch budget sets. Most sit at around sixty hertz, which is fine if you'd like to pretend you're living in 1847, but this modern America, dagnabit. I want my one-hundred-twenty hertz of smooth motion goodness, and I'm not settling for anything less. And speaking of picture quality...<br /><br />3. It's 1080p. Says it right in the title, but I thought I'd remind you in case you'd forgotten already.<br /><br />4. It's cheap! And I don't mean cheap in terms of build-quality. That's actually pretty good, which I'll elaborate on in my next point. No, when I say cheap, I mean most sets with these specs at this size would be going for AT LEAST a hundred dollars more. And even most of the ones sitting at THAT price range will be trading off for either 720p or sixty hertz to keep the price down. What Vizio's offering here is an amazing deal, and Amazon's sweetened the pot with an extra ten dollars off for Prime members. Even Costco isn't selling them that cheap. Then again, you can't pick up a hot dog and a drink for a dollar-fifty while you're on Amazon. Or at least, you shouldn't.<br /><br />5. The build quality--it's actually pretty good.<br /><br />6. The smart menu's easy to access, unobtrusive, and looks about as good as a smart menu can look.<br /><br />Okay, now, on to the cons--<br /><br />1. The smart menu feels a little cluttered. It's got a lot of apps most people won't need, and despite an admittedly short time playing with it, I have yet to figure out how to remove the ones I don't use.<br /><br />2. For having such great specs, the picture quality on this TV doesn't blow me away the same way my fifty does or my old forty. I'm not sure why that is--maybe it's a setting I've missed--but that realism just isn't there to the same degree.<br /><br />3. It's thick. Not huge, mind you, but thicker than some of its counterparts. Did this bother me? No. But for some, I know, thickness is a big factor, either for practical reasons or bragging rights. Because, you know...that's a thing, I guess.<br /><br />4. There's no digital audio out. There's optical, sure, because that's the future. And there's RCA, because...that's the past? But my RS-160s are located in the present, and they operate on digital. Now, this obviously isn't a HUGE deal, since you can spend thirteen dollars to convert your optical to digital, or spent four and change on some RCA adapters, but if you use headphones or a sound system reliant on a digital audio out port, be sure you order some kind of adapter to get it working with this set right out of the box. Because apparently, RCA's still a big deal, but your headphones are a thing of the past.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an amazing deal for a great TV, and despite some very minor flaws, I'd recommend this to anyone looking to spruce up their dorm room, bedroom, office, or studio with a sleek budget television.	4.0	July 21, 2015

amazon.com	First off, ignore the people complaining about the TV they had shipped received as damage. That's a problem with the shipping service, not Vizio. Giving a TV a 1 star rating for a UPS screw up is absolutely stupid. Also, don't let those complaining of a buzz coming from the back ruin your chance at a great product. Some claim they can't even hear the voices of people on TV it's so loud - they're full of it. I have a subwoofer with an amp that makes a way louder buzzing sound that is completely inaudible with just a PC fan running. This TV has a tiny hum, not a BUZZ. You have to stick your head behind the TV with nothing else on to even hear it. It's just electricity and in no way signifies damage. Angry nerds will be angry nerds.<br /><br />There is one issue I have. The ethernet port is on the underside of a part that juts out. It was fine until I bought a new ethernet cable that had a longer doo-hicky on it (for pressing on and releasing it from the port). I now have an ethernet cable forever stuck in my television.<br /><br />Check rtings.com for a general idea of what you'd be getting with the E-series. Read the review, the Q&A, and use the compare tool to see what the competition (Samsung) is like. Also read up on the calibration of colors for these sets. Do keep in mind they say each set of a different size will need to be calibrated differently, but you'll know how complicated of a task you're in for just by checking theirs for the 55&#34; and 60&#34;. Using the color tuner as they did would be a daunting task, requiring a $100+ tool or $100+ service by a professional. For the 40&#34; color tuner I followed a CNET review's calibrations, but I also turned the color up to 60. The optimal amounts of contrast, brightness, and backlight are going to be different for practically everything. Different shows look better with different settings, even games that switch between day and night. It will drive you crazy finding the perfect presets, but you can save up to 6 of them and change individual ones in the little ways needed. I have a separate one for regular PC viewing, PC gaming, Wii U gaming, TV watching, and Netflix. After enough practice I know exactly what to change, but believe me I screwed with the settings for over 24 hours in total before being comfortable with each source. You wouldn't notice on a TV with hardly any settings to change, so really I'm quite satisfied with being able to bring the optimal picture, even to shows that may have filmed with a strangely warm filter added on top. You can set it and forget it if you aren't that technical about it.<br /><br />Different sizes of the E-series have different amounts of lag input, and I know at least 40&#34; and above has game mode to reduce the latency. It doesn't have much of an affect on the picture, other than its intended job in aiding gamers. I suspect the different sized models may have different amounts of motion blur as well. With 60fps sources I don't really notice it. That's the problem with this TV though - most film is 24fps. Watching nature films in 1080p looks great - until they, while close, pan the camera around a mountain. With or without trees, these scenes give the most noticeable amount of motion blur. You can't enjoy the detail of 1080p because of the amount of blur. Turning on Clear Action alleviates the problem, somewhat. While it does decrease motion blur, it also turns the backlight way down and you will notice a flicker. Not just 'sensitive' users as they claim. It's so obvious. I do not use it for anything, but I don't take points off for it being available. Just know there are better sets for watching movies and documentaries. It is still awesome for gaming, however.<br /><br />The panels are VA in the 40, but some larger models will be switching to IPS in the future (or already have?). For gaming you'd want a VA. IPS for movies and television. You can find out which a Vizio has by checking the model number. Just google it.<br /><br />480p upscaling handled by the display is pretty awful when the source is a console like the original Wii. Watching shows off Netflix seems to look better using the Smart App built in rather than using a PC and going to their site, if you're going to be viewing in 384p or 480p. For the shows I watch in that resolution on Netflix, with the noise cancelling options turned to high, even 384p looks great. 720p is pretty good for video games that are natively so; definitely better than my old 720p native television from 2009. 1080p is absolutely wonderful on this set.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Great picture. Not a lot of motion blur, but for gaming you may want to turn on game mode and/or research the pros and cons of 120Hz in current televisions. Great price. The remote received undue complaints concerning its build. Not including a qwerty though, whether that bothers you is preference. I can just put a USB dongle into the TV and use a wireless keyboard, and the only thing I really used it for was for putting in my Netflix login info. Having to make sure you have each input's calibrations right can be a pain, and would be pretty annoying for someone that just can't decide on which settings look best. I obsessed over my presets for longer than most anyone would care to, or that would even consider the difference to be worth the time consumed.The 40&#34; i received has WAY better gray scale uniformity than what rtings.com reviewed it. Same for the black. They did not include the 40&#34; in their review however, so that may be why. For instance with an all black picture they say you can see the LEDs behind the screen. Absolutely not so with the 40&#34;. All you see is the perfect black.<br /><br />I am so glad I did not waste my money on a brand name.	5.0	July 20, 2015
amazon.com	I researched TVs for a month before buying the 50&#34; Vizio E series. Like many, I am excited about the prospects of 4k and OLED.  However, both of these technologies are expensive right now, and impossible to find together.  I set my budget at $1000, yet I ended up with a $500 TV.  My research indicated that a really good 4k TV is more than my budget would allow, and a noticeably and measurably better 1080p set almost doesn't exist.  For twice the money, I didn't think the small improvements over the Vizio E-series would be worth it.<br /><br />I've had this TV for over a month now, and its been great.  On center, the black level is impressive; much better than the IPS panel it is replacing.  Viewing angles are fine; I notice a quality dropoff from dead-center, but I always sit in the same place, and most people aren't so picky.  My backlight is uniform. There are some brighter patches, but they don't bother me for the price I paid.  The corners are slightly darker, but you won't notice if you watch letterbox movies, and dramas usually have darker corners anyway.  Startup time is fast enough and the menus are snappy an logical.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  This TV will be fine until a 4k OLED TVs are within reach.	5.0	July 20, 2015

amazon.com	TV looked nice, but did not meet expectations. Choose this TV over the TCL - Roku TV because I knew the Vizio name and it got pretty good reviews, however, was hesitant because read some negative reviews. Know different people have various interpretations of what they consider &#34;problems&#34;, so opted to give it a try, but  when steaming HD movies/shows, picture would go fuzzy sometimes. Had it conected via HDMI cable, so not sure what the problem was. Ended up returning this TV and decided to go in a different direction (went with my original pic - TCL). Was also disappointed in apps selection. Vizio's advertising is very inaccurate on how many apps this TV has and/or can even get. (in my opinion, Yahoo is not the best partner to have in the world of smart TV apps.) Very limited, especially compared to Roku. The only reason for 2 stars is the helpfulness of Amazon customer service to get this returned.	2.0	July 20, 2015

But there is no option to skip, decline, go back, etc.  I miss my show because of constant &#34;searching for updates&#34; and pop ups for iheart radio.  This is getting returned this week.

amazon.com	I researched and I purchased this TV for our 261BHXL Forest River Camper. There were 4 factors that I was looking for: Smart Tv, LED, Weight & USB input. I found that this tv weighed in only at 11lbs and that was the best that I could find that I thought that I would have been comfortable with leaving it mounted on the wall inside a camper while pulling. The led lighting was newest technology and I bought this due to it helping on weight and depth size of the tv. The Smart portion of the tv we would use at certain campgrounds that offered Wi-Fi and when it rains that would help out with the kids. The final thing was the usb input, For all the movies we can fit on a thumb drive this was something for when there was no wifi or hd antenna would pick up.	5.0	July 19, 2015

amazon.com	I wanted to put this in my toy hauler and access the internet in campgrounds  using MY APPS without my laptop hooked to it with a firewire cable. So I bought this smart tv WRONG choice. Below is why.<br /><br />You can only use what apps that VIzio decided that you need to use. Its preloaded with apps and that's all you can get till Vizor decides to up date them. Unlike the Samsung Smart Tv you can NOT add any of your own apps to this tv or even get on the internet and browse. So in my opinion how can you call this a smart tv?<br /><br />Should of spent the 30 extra dollars and got a real smart tv (Samsung). We own a samsung smart tv in the family room. Comparing the two is like comparing night and day. This is a you get what Vizio thinks you need tv.<br /><br />Yes, you can stream Internet content but it's only what Vizio thinks you should stream. Yes, you can access the Internet but only to what Vizio thinks you should access. BIG PLAY ON WORDS in their ads.	1.0	July 19, 2015

amazon.com	This set is a mixed bag.In terms of being an HDTV it has very good picture quality when viewing over the air broadcast HD signals, the mixed bag comes when you delve into the &#34;Smart TV&#34; aspects of this unit, which are after all the reason you might buy it.<br /><br />The app's are wildly inconsistent, Netflix great, Youtube great, Amazon poor, the App produces 704x400 resolution with Amazon video, not very good, lot's of jaggy pixelated images.<br /><br />When I use the Netgear Push2TV device with my Kindle it works fine but that sort of defeats the purpose of buying a &#34;Smart TV&#34;.<br /><br />This is my first and only &#34;Smart TV&#34; so I cannot make a definitive recommendation but I can say that if you want to use this with the Amazon<br />Prime App you would be be better served buying a &#34;Dumb TV&#34; and a Netgear Push2TV unit.<br /><br />As I continue with my cord cutting experiments I will look at other models but this one I really can't recommend based on the Amazon App being so poorly implemented.	3.0	July 18, 2015

Issues: 1) It does bloom in and out as I'm watching, haven't found a way to fix that. 2) Picture is not the best. Have a difficult time finding a setting that resembles any of the other TV's in the house. 3) If you're not watching it straight on, the picture degrades the more to the side you are. Didn't expect that ! 4) Remote is not difficult to use as others have said. 5) My other TV's show different (more) apps than this one does. That's surprising.<br />I'll debate it for a few more days but may end up returning it for an exchange. Hopefully this could just be a lemon...<br /><br />Update: 1st TV had blooming and fading issues when viewed from the side as others have mentioned. Called to return/exchange TV and the entire process was handled quite well by David K. He got my info and processed the claim with no issues. Was informative and helpful in getting it settled to my satisfaction. New TV received and as of yet does not have the same issues...	3.0	July 16, 2015

amazon.com	If you are considering a new TV or electronics, stay away from VIZIO.  Last night, our smart screen had a pixel blow in the middle and crack the screen from the inside.  There is nothing on the outside of the tv.  Bought the TV back in November.  After several calls back and forth with customer service today, I was told at 6:00 pm they were sending us a new TV.  Got a call back at 8:30 pm saying that it wasn't covered so we were out of luck.  They won't back down even though they had already said they were sending a replacement.  We have had several issues with this TV before this but this beats it all.  The remote is terrible.  It doesn't work half the time and you have to take the batteries out and reset it to get it to work.  This summer, the TV itself started freezing up. We would have to unplug the tv and discharge all the power to get it to work. The screen breaks on its own during the warranty time and we are out of luck even though they initially said they were replacing it. Terrible product and service.  Will never buy another Vizio again.  Stay far away.	1.0	July 15, 2015
amazon.com	I know that there are 381 reviews you can go through.  I realize that is a lot.  I want to share, however, that I am so pleased with this Vizio TV.  I ordered it through Prime and once again it arrived in 2 days in perfect condition.  This television is 50 inches.  My family and friends gave me grief, telling me it's going to be way to big.  But it's not!  It's perfect!  The quality of the picture is really beautiful.  I was nervous at first with my satellite reception in HD was not going to be that nice, but it far surpassed my expectations.  The 1080i is extremely clear and when I have my Apple TV turned on for Netflix it is also in 1080i and just as vivid and clear.  I cannot say enough about this television and do recommend to all who are contemplating buying one.	5.0	July 15, 2015
amazon.com	Very Capable Smart TV and a good size for my need.  The TV installed without any issues in less then 15 minutes.  The connection to the internet, Amazon Prime and Netflix was a snap as well.  The TV is also built on a low stand which as exactly what I needed as it had to fit into a confined space, this allowed me to buy a 32&#34; versus something smaller, which is good.  The remote is also good, as there is one button access for both Amazon Prime and Netflix.  Finely, the picture quality is excellent and sound isn't too bad for such a small TV, works well in the bedroom where it's located.  I would recommend this TV to a friend.	5.0	July 15, 2015

amazon.com	Lack of native 5GHz wireless support dampens an otherwise well engineered product. The picture quality responds well to adjustment and can be configured to suit personal preferences. For example, by transferring the calibration values from a Top Tier 40&#34; Samsung used for gaming which was calibrated using the HDTV feature included with XBOX ONE, the Vizio E50-C1 largely assumed the same visual impression albeit not at the same level of refinement, losing some of the picture clarity and detail that makes the Samsung (3D Model) picture seem almost surreal because of its sharpness, color range, and contrast dynamics even when viewing streaming content. It makes up for this with 5 zone dynamics optimization which delivers absolute blacks and is actually better than the Samsung in this regard. The menu system and auto configuration features are also better.<br /><br />For the price and considering the screen size, this model is a home run for consumers seeking value in the larger 50&#34; form factor whom choose to stick with the HDTV standard instead of transitioning to the newer 4K Ultra standard (with Ultra pricing) that require more bandwidth to feed such as Cat 7 network cabling or disk based playback to realize the improvements in resolution.  Adding an Amazon Fire TV which fully supports 5GHz AC wireless transmitting standards, makes the 2.4 GHz native feature of this set a minor issue. Even the Amazon Fire Stick works well and appears in the input menu by name. The Vizio remote can also automatically replace the Fire TV remote although certain nags will briefly appear as the Fire TV tries to locate its paired remote partner.<br /><br />Overall this is a great value.	4.0	July 14, 2015
amazon.com	To go along with the sound bar you have to have a big TV! We have 2 VIZIO TVs in our house and have never had any issues with them. We were lucky enough to get this type of TV even cheaper from target because the owner’s manual was missing. There is actually one on the TV if you have a problem looking for something. The smart TV feature is cool about this TV. The TV includes apps such as YouTube, Netflix, iHeart Radio, etc. This is a convenient feature to have on the TV.

amazon.com	I have been having serious issues with this model since it was installed on my wall.  Let me first state, I've been a Vizio fan and buyer since 2007.  Back then, I purchased a 32&#34; 720p and a 37&#34; 720p.....both worked fine right out of the box and never an issue.  In fact, they're both working just fine today.  About a week prior to purchasing this set, I purchased an E-43 through another seller......have had issues with that one also......one HDMI doesn't work.......the rest of the bugs I've managed to work out.  Currently, I'm working with Vizio to see if the issues on the E-50 can be worked out.  Some I have managed to correct myself.  I think I finally have the color dialed in.  The first issue was getting the wi-fi to sync up.  It took a few days and I'm good to go in that department.  I am doing everything I can to resolve these issues prior to the 30 day return period expire.  I hate to return anything to Amazon as they've treated me like family.  During the past 8<br />months, I've had horrible luck when purchasing anything electronic or electrical on line.  If I have to return, the question that comes to mind is......do I ask for a replacement of the same model or should I step up to the Vizio 4K model?  As stated earlier, I am a big fan of Vizio and Amazon.  I do hope to come back soon and update my review with a higher rating. UPDATE:  7/25/2015.  I've increased my rating by one star due to issues being resolved.  There are sites online that give recommendations of how and what to adjust the color to.  I did as instructed and my color is great.  I recommend the Vizio Sound Bar for a much better sound.  The difference is astounding and worth the investment.  With the two Vizios I purchased in 2007, I didn't place and extended warranty on either of them and they're both still working just fine.  Based on a ton of reviews I've read on the Internet, I found buyers were having issues between 1 1/2 to to years which is outside of Vizios warranty period.  With that in mind, I placed an extended warranty to cover the first four years.  Square Trade was my choice and found, if you shop online, you can find a better price.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  that you purchase a surge protector (these are a cheap add on) as I have done this with all my electronic equipment.  Please be aware surge protectors have a limited useful life and have to be replaced periodically (5 years?).  I hate to have to return anything to Amazon.  Today is the end of my 30 day grace period and I'm happy to say THIS IS A KEEPER.  Granted, it took some time on my part to work out the issues but well worth my time for the end result.	3.0	July 12, 2015

Its picture right out of the box is spectacular. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. the only thing missing is a POWER BUTTON! I know it sounds silly, but its true! The only way to turn this set off and on is with the remote! I'll eventually get around to programing the Comcast remote so it might not be that big of a deal soon. Other than that, its really a good TV. The setup is really easy. It even renames the HDMI1 input to &#34;Cable Box&#34; for you. Very happy with the purchase.	4.0	July 11, 2015

amazon.com	After hitting a previous M-32 model VIZIO bedroom sized TV with the vacuum cleaner and  breaking the screen. I ordered the newer E-32 as a replacement.. The picture is great running off an older roof antenna boosted by a 21 Db. Amp that captures 16 channels in HD in my fringe area. The backlit Led.'s give an even sharp picture with my own calibrated settings. The newer E series in 32&#34; lacks the zone feature of the previous M series, but I have not noticed any difference in quality of the black tones, nor have I had any pixilation problems on fast moving sports. The 120 refresh rate seems to work as advertised and the fast motion 240 settings must be working also.. This VIZIO is every bit as good as the more expensive Samsung I use in the family area.. I would recommend this set for use in any low light 225 Sq. Ft. room, it's size is perfect without overwhelming the viewer.. and the remote is simple to operate by feel alone.	4.0	July 10, 2015

The TV is in flawless condition; no dead pixels,no damage, & no scratches!<br /><br />Now that we got that out of the way, I'd like to talk about the TV itself:<br /><br />I googled a lot of information before choosing this brand of TV & they said out of all of the 40&#34; TV brands of a 1080p TV, ViZio was the best.<br /> I can't really say if ViZio is the best tv to get if looking for a 40&#34; tv but I can tell you it isn't a bad choice. I'm coming from a Samsung ES8000 46&#34; and the only flaw that I don't like out of this TV is the clear action option which makes the screen darker, the black detail which makes the picture look like crap, & the active led zones which does about the same as the clear action which all of these settings can be turned off if not like which is a good thing. I played a few PS4 games on it and wasn't unhappy at all it runs fast and looks great with no complaints from me and I'm a serious gamer lol. Just like every other TV the Sun is a huge distraction. So, try keeping the Sun away from the tv or you won't be happy watching tv.<br /><br />Every TV I get I search for the best settings & then play around with it until I'm happy with the settings. For this TV, I went here:<br />1.http://www.rtings.com/reviews/tv/lcd-led/vizio/e-series-2015<br />& 2. http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/vizio-e-series-2015-picture-settings-642363/<br /><br />Then like I said I play with the settings. I like everything they suggested just I added more to the Backlight, Brightness, and color.<br /><br />My settings are:<br />Picture Mode &#60;Calibrated Dark&#62;<br />Backlight=100<br />Brightness=62<br />Contrast=80<br />Color=60<br />Tint=0<br />Sharpness=10<br />----------------------------<br />More Picture&#62;&#62;:<br />Color Temperature=COOL<br />Black Detail=OFF<br />Active LED Zones=OFF<br />Clear Action=OFF<br />Reduce Noise=LOW for both<br />Game Low Latency=OFF<br />Film Mode=Auto<br />Gama=2.2<br />-----------------------------------------<br />Color Calibration&#62;&#62;:<br />Red Gain= -2<br />Green Gain= 1<br />Blue Brightness=16\||\Offset=1<br />----------------------------<br />11 Point White Balance&#62;&#62;:<br />10%: 8, 5, 7<br />20%: -14, -14, -13<br />30%: -35, -33, -33<br />40%: -30, -30, -30<br />50%: -30, -28, -32<br />60%: 0, 0, -5<br />70%: 0, 0, -5<br />80%: 0, 0, 0<br />90%: 0, 0, 0<br />100%: 0, 0, 0<br />____________________________<br />The TV comes with 3 hdmi which I wish had 4 just because. Other things:<br />USB,HDMI, & Audio out are on the side but opposite from the power cord.<br />Behind the TV are 2 HDMIs, Ethernet, Component, & DTV.<br />AS you know this is a smart TV and it has its own store to download more apps if would like to.<br />TV remote is great it has a amazon video prime & netflix button just not sure why they didn't add a hulu one but instead they put a iheartradio which  pandora is better imo....<br />The remote also has a smart home button which pulls up your apps..<br />Some shows that have blackbars which I seriously hate, this TV has an option to stretch the screen which is lovely but only works on some not all depending on how the blackbars are positioned.<br /><br />I hope this was a helpful review not really sure of anything to add that could help anymore... So now it's up to you to decide if you want to buy it or not.	4.0	July 10, 2015
amazon.com	As of right now (July 10,2015),this tv works just fine.I have Cable and Netflix,and they hooked right up to it with no problems.The picture looks good.Overall a good working class TV.	2.0	May 1, 2015
amazon.com	great TV Well worth the money. This is our 3rd Visio. would not buy any other brand.	5.0	July 9, 2015
amazon.com	Definitely the nicest TV that I've ever owned.  Then again I've alway's choosen VIZIO products.  Personally I've never had a minute's problem with any other TVs soundbars subwoofers all been great.  The price was amazing couldn't even come close to it locally.  Well packaged, no issues with shipping, I  tracked it all the way to my home. Real time updates.  I definitely will recommend it to friends.	5.0	July 9, 2015
amazon.com	Easy to set up, picture is very clear and easy to change settings.  A couple of the presets for picture are not to my liking, but it is great to be able to set my own settings as part of the options.  This TV is much better picture and ease of use than the previous 52&#34;, like the smaller screen.	4.0	July 9, 2015
amazon.com	Description didn't say how many HDMI ports it had,so I went through reviews where they were saying 3 and some occasionaly saying 4,didn't really buy that but my last vizio had 3(the minimum I need) so I went for it.Only to be very disappointed to only have 2 hdmi ports.Who still does that with all the stuff that we need to connect to our tvs.Doubt I will ever buy a vizio again now which is sad because I really loved my last one,still going strong and now in the guest bedroom.These things should be clearly marked in the specs of all your tvs.I could have gotten 1 with the 3 HDMIs for the same price or maybe a little less.To sum it up,certainly a great tv just not what i needed and thought I was getting,and as much as I love Amazon I may just have to go Brick and Mortar for my electronics since then I know what I'm getting.	3.0	July 9, 2015
amazon.com	Purchased for my bedroom, once again Vizio delivers. Great price for what you get. Picture looked great too. Sound is good but you have to have the volume over 50 before you can hear anything decently. My 50' Vizio is auditable at 10-15 so I originally thought there was something wrong with the speakers at first until I read other reviews. only 4 stars because of the audio volume.	4.0	July 9, 2015

amazon.com	I bought the 65&#34; and the picture looks great!!!  My previous TV was an LG LCD.  So, clearly this one is a huge upgrade.<br /><br />Adjustments to the picture are easy.<br /><br />Set up was a snap.<br /><br />I was thinking a sound bar might be necessary, but after viewing it the sound is really great out of the TV.  If I want more of a surround affect, then I might add speakers later.	5.0	July 8, 2015

amazon.com	I evidently did a bit better than average, since my tv lasted almost two years instead of the more usual 18 months before breaking down.  One day in the middle of watching tv, suddenly neither the remote nor the manual buttons on the TV work.  The tv can't be turned on or off, can't call up menus, no streaming, can't change the channel, nothing.  After a lot of runaround, Vizio customer service &#34;can't do anything&#34; because I'm out of warranty.  Yes, it's been almost 2 years but really, a total breakdown of all functionality of my &#34;smart&#34; tv is an utter product-quality fail.  I will never buy Vizio anything ever again.	1.0	July 6, 2015
amazon.com	I don't keep up with all the TV technology lingo, but I can say this TV is perfect for me.  4 HDMI, Smart TV, wireless.  It integrated well with all my other junk and it looks great.  The deliver was spot on in regards to timing and professionalism.  The TV delivery guy even set it up to make sure it worked.  65&#34; under $1000...couldn't be more happy	5.0	July 6, 2015

amazon.com	I received the first TV from Amazon, set it up and it immediately seemed at though the TV could not handle inputs from the remote.  I changed the batteries and still had issues.  The tv would not respond to any of the remote buttons and was also frozen.  Volume would not go up or down and the TV wouldn't even shut off with out unplugging it.  I called Amazon and they sent out a new TV right away. (Customer service was good)  The second TV arrived, worked for two days and then the same problems arrived.  I will not buy a Vizio television again	1.0	July 6, 2015

amazon.com	broke on the 31st day, one day after the return date passed : (	1.0	July 5, 2015
amazon.com	Love the look, style, design and remote. Perhaps it happened in shipping, but occasionally the sound gets muffled  or gets so low it is hard to hear. There is also an approximately 1&#34; line at the very top that looks like the old &#34;snow&#34; we used to have, back in the old days, on the entire screen. It is not always there but pops up occasionally. I think the picture is good quality but I am not the expert. The wife says the color too fleshy on backgrounds and as we were just watching the women win the FIFA crown it appeared to have a lot of have a fog coming and going during the game.	3.0	July 5, 2015
amazon.com	great TV only downside is it only has 2 HDMI ports I have to use  a switcher to handle 3 inputs. Sadly I have 2 Vizio smart TV's and neither will get ACORN. I have to use a Roku stick for that.	5.0	July 5, 2015
amazon.com	Had it for about a month now and it's a great TV!	5.0	July 5, 2015
amazon.com	I'm very happy with this TV.  It is just the perfect size for the room. It is so clear that we can now plainly see everything including imperfections of what is being recorded.  Unfortunately, I could not get the TV to interface with my WIFI but that was solved by using a Smart Samsung Disc player which easily connected with the WIFI router that was only six feet away from the television.  So problem solved.	2.0	May 1, 2015
amazon.com	Very nice TV, love the smart apps...although i don`t see the need for the music app, and I'd much rather have a Netflix button...	4.0	July 4, 2015
amazon.com	The picture in the screen fades in out dark to light, very annoying and not good for movies.	1.0	July 4, 2015
amazon.com	Pros: The picture is sharp and vivid in daylight, the blacks are very dark as well. There aren't a lot of video or audio settings but the standard picture settings are easy to understand and access. There seems to be a good variety of smart TV apps, which are just a button away. The wireless connection wasn't too difficult to set up and signal strength from a room away is pretty strong.<br /><br />Cons: The screen is a bit reflective, especially in low light settings. The is no VGA input. The remote control does not have a QWERTY keyboard, so typing can be a lit slow when accessing the smart functions.	5.0	July 4, 2015

amazon.com	great buy.	4.0	July 3, 2015
amazon.com	The TV arrived undamaged, and exactly as described. I haven't had any issues with the TV being connected to our wireless network. So far, so good.....	5.0	July 3, 2015
amazon.com	Awesome communication great product in perfect condition right on time very grateful and very very happy with the purchase in all aspects of the purchase thank you	5.0	July 2, 2015
amazon.com	I got the 40 inch one as a gift and while it does have an incredible value, I would not recommend this to people who want an excellent HD viewing experience. It may be true that this set can deliver 1080p picture quality, but it cannot do so constantly at high frame rates without randomly displaying a &#34;choppiness&#34; or &#34;clippiness&#34; in whatever you are watching (game, movie, show, etc). This one fatal flaw breathes despair and shame over this otherwise excellent set. I will be returning mine. I can't recommend this tv unless you want your viewing experience to be filled with frustration and sadness.	2.0	July 2, 2015
amazon.com	I love my new t.v. Clear picture and sound is good. Worth the money.	5.0	July 1, 2015
amazon.com	My 100 year old grandfather loves this. He is amazed by the clarity.	5.0	July 1, 2015
amazon.com	Great tv. Only issue is the WIFI is spotty when none of my other devices have issues.	4.0	July 1, 2015
amazon.com	Very nice television.  I am very pleased.  The picture is really clear.  The reason I only gave four stars is because some of the buttons on the remote are not to well put together.  I am afraid it will not last very long and with this being a smart t.v. you need this remote.  But overall excellent quality and price.	4.0	July 1, 2015
amazon.com	Arrived very well packaged and on time. We bought the 50 inch. It is perfect for our bedroom! We easily mounted it to the wall(mount not included). I love how light weight this TV is(28 lbs.). The controller is cheap feeling but is working great so far and fits nice in your hand with great button placement! The TV itself feels a little cheap but what do you expect for the price. We have a very expensive Samsung TV in our living room and seriously this TV is just as great!- so low price doesn't always mean worse. We don't use the apps or anything else like that so cannot comment on those. The picture is great and very clear. The sound is not too bad but wasn't to my liking, so my husband bought the Vizio 29 inch sound bar and that pairs very well with this TV! Save yourself some money and buy this TV- and maybe even the sound bar!:)	5.0	July 1, 2015

It can change your display setting and can also change the firmware of your TV. So be careful. Picture can go dark and HDMI ports can become unresponsive. It is better to check on internet for your model of Tv has any comparability problem with chromecast.

This product is updated regularly by google and more and more apps are available on play store which are chromecast enabled. Go fot it.

A good handy camera. really like it

DrAmit	Sep 20, 2015	4
This is worth buy. The Sleek and lightweight grip of the body make things easy. Timelapse video recording is also very good. Grip Sensor works very fine. Not checked with the waterproof resistance yet. It can capture motions in the camera perfectly. General Video recording is in 1080p but slowmotion video recording is not in 1080p. You can edit settings in the app. To install the app you must have buletooth 4.0 or wifi direct and android 4.3 above. Overall its a good buy. Waiting for all the mounts available in Indian Market.

parvinderrakhra	Dec 11, 2014	5
I bought this HTC RE Camera in December and it's started cracking from bottom of the body. Picture and video quality is excellent but as per HTC it's waterproof, but now it's not waterproof for me. So as per me build quality is so poor and not worth to buy it.

Saurabh	Feb 09, 2015	5
Awesome camera.. Loving all the wide angles and the flexibility of holding it from different perspectives. The RE app for the phone (Android + Apple) is fantastic. Tells you everything you need to know about the camera's settings and viewing photos are simple and convenient. However there is a little image stability issue with the RE. One move and the picture goes shaky but with a little precision and practice it's a terrific buy for the price and specs!

an affordable cam for daylight use and under water(with the waterproof cap which has to be purchased seperately) photography ,quickly connects with android devices (i tried with oneplus one )but if we have to buy accessories and it is  hard to find them in offline stores and as well as online stores

Riya	Sep 25, 2015	5
Video quality is mind-blowing. Remote photo capturing using phone feature makes RE better than other options.

Bhagi	Sep 22, 2015	5
Taking video and pictures with this camera is one touch operation .easy to carry and even fits in pocket extra added water proof fecility without any outer housings is a ausome thing to use it in rainy situations too.definetly ill recommend
