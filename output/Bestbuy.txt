bestbuy.com	I was looking for LED TV to replace my old analog TV. I didn't want to spend too much obviously after having that old TV this long. Also I wanted a larger 32". I saw good reviews although this seemed to be a non-popular brand. I watched prices of different brands same features and Insignia was far less. I eventually found one that was returned labeled scratched but I could not find anything wrong with it and all accessories still in the package. They did not have a box but they wrapped it nicely with bubble and plastic wrap. It turned out to be a great buy since the money I saved I used to purchased the extended warranty. Good pic quality. Fit perfect in bedroom armoire.	5.0	2015-09-26

bestbuy.com	I have had my TV for just over a year, its only a few weeks past the warranty and it no longer works. I am having issues getting the TV to power on, and if it does power on it won't stay on. I did some research and found that this is a fairly common issue with insignia TVs. Guess I should've done some research before buying and I suggest you do the same. My advice though, you get what you pay for, so steer clear of this TV unless you want to start shoveling money into it a year later trying to buy replacement parts to fix it yourself (since tech support is as much as the tv cost if its out of warranty).	2.0	2015-09-26

bestbuy.com	It's definitely not a Samsung TV or LG TV but at least its good for basic quality HD TV. It does have a pretty resolution to it (depends on the strength of your signal) and It's pretty decent for gamers not too bad. But if you are looking for something cheap that will still do its job ok. Than this TV is for you!	3.0	2015-09-14
bestbuy.com	You know by the price that this isn't the world's best television, but for $160, you can't beat it. I bought it to use with my Xbox One. I play my Xbox from about seven or eight feet away, and there is nothing at all wrong with the picture from that distance (I can't speak for much at other distances if you're picky about the resolution of your HDTVs). It's a good size for a bedroom, and if I were to need another TV sometime in the near future, I would likely get another one of this one. Since it's not full 1080p, some of you may not be super satisfied, but the picture is plenty clear in my opinion. Great TV if you're on a budget. Setup is super easy. I would highly recommend.	5.0	2015-09-13

bestbuy.com	10 years or so my parents bought a 32 inch LCD for their home. It was a Toshiba and they paid close to $1500 if I recall correctly.<br />FFW to 2015: I just paid $139 for 32 LED that picturewise beats that Toshiba in every way. This is a very basic TV but efter spending about 20 min tuning the picture, using my Panasonic plasma as reference, I'm shaking my head in wonder. I'm watching UFC on UVERSE and the picture quality is remarkable, for the money. I will also add a Roku stick and then I have all the video media options I need.<br />The sound is totally ok and I actually find the clarity quite good.<br />This our new bedroom TV and the first 5 hrs of ownership has been an unmitigated success.	5.0	2015-08-23

bestbuy.com	We purchased this TV so we could get OTA transmission...we cut the cord and decided to upgrade our TV. It has a beautiful picture, very clear and true color, and decent sound. Honestly, for the price, I don't know if you could do better! The one downside is that it's hard to know how to find stations that it doesn't locate when you do the antenna search. For example, when I did the antenna search, it missed several stations because I was having trouble getting transmission at that moment. I had to look up how to add these stations...it's not an obvious feature and it's not in the instructions. Apparently, this is a feature lacking on this TV that others have complained about for several years. But other than that, the sound and picture are good for a smallish room.	4.0	2015-08-19

bestbuy.com	I was looking at a higher resolution but smaller screen tv and then saw this Insignia model, which was a little bigger but with a slower refresh rate. Predominantly using HD devices, I was reluctant to go for a "lesser quality" picture for the sake of size. After speaking with an associate I decided that any slight difference in picture quality would be offset by more overall visibility. I'm very glad I did, this TV was a great value. Picture is great. Ideal for small to medium sized bedrooms. Also can double as a computer monitor. Overall very pleased.	4.0	2015-08-11

It took me 15-20 minutes to set up, following clear instructions that were included, and that includes taking it out of the box and figuring out what to set it on.

bestbuy.com	My son's TV was acting up so we decided to replace it. Space is a concern as it fits between a door and a closet so we were limited to 32" or less. The TV has excellent picture quality and sound (for the price). The DirecTV box, the Wii U, and a DVD player all hooked up easily and the menu allows you to rename the inputs (which makes it easier for a 7 year old to understand which input is which). Both he and I are happy with the purchase.	5.0	2015-07-17
