amazon.com	I snagged this TV for $310 at Walmart.  Sweet deal evm if I had paid $388. For the money you get all you can ask for.  Great picture and apps for playing video and music.  All the hookups you'll need too.<br /><br />But there are a few things sacrificed quality wise in order to manufacture a TV  at such a low price point.  Structurally, the plastic framing on this thing is DIRT CHEAP.  You can bend it by just pushing it a little.  If it takes a fall it will certainly not survive.  I highly recommend a good mount so it is not knocked over by kids or dogs.  Being cheap, it is wayyyy light though, so mounting is a cinch.  Secondly, the added video features meant to improve quality don't work at all from what I've experienced.  The best way I've found for maximum picture quality is to go into the &#34;more picture &#34; settings, turn off all features except for zones, and on the picture presets use ANYTHING but standard.  Standard is meant to save energy, and as you know, that lowers the brightness making your picture less good.<br /><br />So with a good mount and some tweaking in the video settings, this is a great television at a great price.	5.0	October 5, 2015

amazon.com	After 5 weeks of viewing, this television stopped powering on/off by remote and from the power button on the back. As well, the screen size is stuck in small viewing and you cannot access any of the apps for viewing such as Netflix or amazon. At first we thought it needed batteries in the remote however, not the case. We have to turn it off by removing the power source. I would certainly like a replacement however I am 1 week past the 30 day guarantee. As always, the shipping is on time and packaged well.	1.0	October 4, 2015
amazon.com	I was a little unsure about ordering as I never owned a Vizio. The verdict is in. It's a great TV at an amazing price. The picture is very sharp and the colors are great.

amazon.com	I have received multiple of these TVs from Amazon, and none of them work. The first one did not work right out of the box--it would power on, but the screen would stay black. The second one--the replacement that Amazon sent me--worked for about 3 weeks, and then just stopped working one day while i was watching TV. The TV turned off, and i could not turn it back on. It was as if the power on the TV just failed.<br /><br />I have spent hours and hours on hold with amazon customer service because of this tv. DO NOT BUY IT. the picture quality is good, but it simply doesn't work. I have had problems with Vizio products in the past. I think their products have many known issues.	1.0	October 4, 2015

amazon.com	I have two other older model Vizeo Smart TV's on my unsecured wifi network and they were a snap to setup. I do not have cable TV and only use the apps to watch TV. I could not get this to connect and support said it had to be a secured network??? I added a password to my network and it was able to connect to all the content apps like NetFlix and Amazon but it would say the network was disconnected when I tried to go to the app store to download new apps. They said to wait a couple days and make sure it gets all the updates then call them back if it still will not connect.<br />I had no problem getting through to their support and they were very helpful. Will update if time cures the problem.<br />Update on 6/29/15: After 5 calls to Vizio support the person I talked to a few minutes ago had me change the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and everything worked fine. Just go into the network settings and then to manual setup. Turn DNS from ON to OFF and put in 8.8.8.8 for the DNS and everything worked fine and I c... Read more	4.0	October 2, 2015

amazon.com	I am very happy with this purchase. When I went through the TV selection process, I knew I was looking for a 60+ inch HD Smart TV. I had considered 4K but decided against it since there is not much you can watch in 4K yet. I also spoke with someone that writes for &#34;Wired&#34; magazine who gave me some good tips. I have included below the general summary of why I chose this TV as well as links to websites that can go into much more detail on pros and cons.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Vizio generally has the best bang for the buck. The company produces TVs with good picture quality at a highly reduced price to its competitors. The general consensus is that Samsung will produce slightly better picture quality, but I and others I have spoken with, do not think the price trade-off is not worth it. A comparable TV made by Samsung (&#34;Samsung UN65J6300&#34;) will run you about 50% more than this TV. I have looked at the picture on both TVs and was honestly unable to tell a difference. When you buy Vizio, you do need to pay attention to the panels the TV uses because Vizio will use different panels for different sized TVs (of the same model). Basically, the higher Hz numbers in a panel generally equate to improved motion resolution (i.e., reduced blurring). This TV has a 120Hz panel, but if you drop down to the 60-inch, the panel is only 60Hz.  If you are looking for a lot more detail, I have provided below links to some of the review websites I used when making this purchase.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.<br /><br />http://www.cnet.com/products/vizio-e-series-2015/<br />http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/best<br /><br />Best,<br />Dave	5.0	October 2, 2015

Surely others will appear. 1 star for not testing your product before selling. Should have bought a samsung.<br /><br />Update:<br />After connecting to my WiFi to connect to Netflix, the TV automatically updated. WiFi has not worked since. I've tried the factory reset, service reset, power cycle and hard reset. It just keeps getting better. Sigh.	1.0	October 2, 2015

amazon.com	I would have given this pile of junk 0 stars if I could.  I purchased this and received it within 2 days so far great job by Amazon, it was delivered by 9am great job by FedEx.  Here the problems start.  I had this out of the box for 2 hours, just long enough to get the stand attached and the channels programmed in, then I sit down to watch some afternoon television and it becomes unresponsive, the only way to shut it off is to kill the power, when you shut it off and turn it back on you can push 2 buttons on the remote before it locks up again.  So I contact Amazon about sending it back and they send me a return address label right away and have my money refunded before I get back from the UPS store.  After reading the reviews this seems to be a common problem for Vizio and I will never purchase anything made by them again.	1.0	September 30, 2015

I love that I can play YouTube videos from my phone to it and having the Netflix button on the remote is a huge time saver. For some reason it is not syncing up to my DirecTV DVR correctly but I think it is the DVR not the TV because as soon as I turn off the DVR and turn it back on it works. Otherwise it works great with the WIFI features and my PS3.	5.0	September 29, 2015

amazon.com	The package arrived undamaged and in New condition. I read several reviews and worried about this model a bit. As for my experience, this Tv does really well as just a TV. The smart functions on this Tv have cause mine to freeze up and refuse to respond to my remote, a universal remote that was properly programmed, and the tv's physical power button. After power cycling the TV 3-4 times I gave up on the smart functions and disconnected it from the internet and viola it works perfectly. I run Netflix through my Xbox anyways so it's not a huge loss for me. Still a nice TV with great detail and color.	3.0	September 29, 2015

amazon.com	TV has been performing beautifully, connecting to wifi and different accounts (Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, etc) was easy. Main concerns were two noticeable points where the screen protruded from the plastic frame, possibly from poor assembly or packaging, and the lack of a remote. The TV only houses a power button, making it impossible to use for literally anything until you either purchase the brand name remote, or go the way I did and find a programmable universal remote for about 1/6th the price. TL;DR- Good buy, not great thanks to some inconveniences	4.0	September 29, 2015
amazon.com	I like the picture quality and the sound isn't bad for a cheap TV. I am very disappointed in Vizo/Yahoo's app ecosystem though. I wish I would have looked into it a little closer before purchasing. I assumed the major sports apps (MLB TV, NFL Gamepass, MLS) would be there, but they aren't. It isn't a huge deal since I also have my Desktop hooked up to this TV for gaming so I can just stream it on my computer and display it on the TV, but I was disappointed that I don't have the option of streaming through an app (I'm lazy sometimes and don't want to turn my computer on and bring the mouse and keyboard over to my bed from the desk). Overall, it has a great picture for the price.	4.0	September 29, 2015

amazon.com	Considering it is a less expensive TV, it is a great buy. The TV is working out great. It has good quality at 1080p and comes with good speakers. The only negative is the clicker, which isn't very comfortable to use (can sometimes be annoying to click the buttons, but I have larger hands) but it still works fine. It would have been nice if the TV had buttons directly on the TV in case you lose the remote, but overall, this TV was a great purchase and I dont regret buying it. I would recommend the TV and i would buy it again.	5.0	September 28, 2015

Out of the box color settings were completely off. Even once calibrated it showed strong yellow on  the normal setting. Which brings me to my next point it is extremely difficult to set this TV up and be 100 percent satisfied. Set was returned.

With no solution to fix the problem.<br /><br />This is an issue that Vizio has swept under the rug with their smart TVs for years, they refuse to fix it.

amazon.com	I purchased the 50” version of this Vizio a couple months ago for my apartment at college. Overall, this television is exceptional but like most products has some flaws. Here are a few categories.<br /><br />Picture:<br />My roommates and I have a relatively small living room so it was hard to set up the television in an ideal location. Therefore, we have a sliding door to the left that should, as most televisions would, produce a glare. Somehow this television has never given us a problem with the glare, which is perfect for our setup. Along with that, the few HD channels that are provided to us through our cable provider have great picture quality.<br /><br />Remote:<br />Frankly, I think this is a horribly designed remote. Sure, the buttons aren’t bad and they do provide some shortcuts if you are looking for Netflix, iHeart Radio, or Amazon Instant Video. However, the whole back of the remote comes off for the battery replacement, which could easily be changed to a snap on back to make it more secure. Because the back is unstable, if you are trying to change channels the back just sort of slides off. This is an annoying feature that may need to be fixed with duct tape.<br /><br />Sound:<br />I cannot give my opinion on the sound due to external subs connected to the television.<br /><br />Price:<br />I give the price rating for this product a 5/5. This Vizio is listed at $528, but with Amazon Prime I received a $30 discount. Once you add in Amazon’s deals of free shipping and no tax, the total comes to $498. Quite the bargain for a 50” television let alone a Smart TV.<br /><br />Basically, if you can deal with the back of the remote, then this item is a steal. A 50” 1080p Smart LED HDTV with this price is practically unheard of, especially for a VIZIO. This is the television for you, whatever size you choose.	4.0	September 24, 2015
amazon.com	First I thought it is very difficult to compare anything with samsung or Sony TV. I was dead wrong.<br />When I saw the clarity of pic in vizio it blew my mind. Resolution is excellent .<br />It is so clear and very reasonable price compare to other TV.<br />I believe that would be smart move to get this smart tv.	5.0	September 24, 2015

amazon.com	Put this tv in my kitchen where I ran cat6 Ethernet to the back and it works very well.  Picture is very nice.  Sound is just ok.  It's not the fastest or smoothest when getting into Netflix or browsing titles, but it streams perfect.  I love it.	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	It's a nice looking TV - the bezel is very thing and has a nice, simple design.  I could care less about the apps - I have all of those through other devices, so I'm really just interested in the TV.<br /><br />I'm not sure if there's something special about the 28&#34; TV, but there aren't many 1080p options in that size - and this is no exception @ 720p.  Maybe for that reason, the picture isn't nearly as clear as my 24&#34; computer monitor or my 10 year old, 46&#34; LCD TV (which is 1080p).  The picture in the VIZIO appears aliased (jagged edges) and the colors aren't very good, even after several attempts at adjusting.  The picture looks like what you would expect coming from a cheap TV that you'd find in a motel.<br /><br />The price is nice and it's nice to look at while turned off, but I wouldn't recommend this as a TV that you will use often - it just isn't very good as a TV.	3.0	September 23, 2015
amazon.com	Vizio has such great reviews I figured it must be worth buying. No other LED TV has taken such a short amount of time to setup. It is a great thing when you get something new and it actually works well.	5.0	September 23, 2015
amazon.com	So far, great.  They make excellent PC monitors if you don't need/want 4K.  They have a &#34;Gaming&#34; and &#34;Computer&#34; picture mode, for an easy preset.  I've played SWTOR with them @1080p, and it looks amazing.  Great size screen with a thin bezel.  Also, just to note, I thought they were very light for the size; my previous 24'' monitors were actually a lot heavier.	5.0	September 23, 2015
amazon.com	Returning it. Connect it to the internet and it becomes unresponsive. Not going to play games. Looking to purchase a Samsung. Just wasting your time to buy one.	1.0	September 23, 2015
amazon.com	Waited until the 2016 models were close to coming out, so I could get this for less. I like Vizio and this is my third generation set I got from them (other two still work used in another house). Doesn't have PIP but I'm not sure anyone offers that now, I guess I'm still living in the 90's. I don't use the smart TV functions since I use a laptop to access the web. I'm about 10 feet away from it and I love it. I also bought the Vizio 2.1 soundbar so I'm not using the TV internal sound. I don't have very good eyesight though so anything big and inexpensive was a winner for me. I'd take this over a Magnavox or RCA or no-name brand based on my own experiences. Delivery service was good enough and this set is too big for UPS to destroy so the set arrived in great condition.	5.0	September 23, 2015
amazon.com	A great tv for the price. I bought a Vizio previously and it was quite dependable. The image is great, after some adjustments to your specific preferred settings. Your regular tv viewing, movies and video games will all look great with 1080p and 1080i images. The only thing I haven't tried out was the apps, I set up the wi-fi, but I have a Playstation 4, so I use that for Netflix, HBOGo, etc. Overall a great purchase.	5.0	September 23, 2015

amazon.com	Seems to be a good HDTV, with one exception in my case. . .the TV Wi-Fi has an extremely short range. I live in a 2-story home, and had my modem/router hooked up on the bottom floor (studio). I purchased this TV as a display (for upstairs) for my DVdeck as well as a HDTV for my grand daughters when they spend the night with us. Upstairs the Vizio 24&#34; would just not reliably keep the Wi-Fi connection. . .it kept dropping out, warning me about low bandwidth, etc., despite the fact that there were several other TV's, desktops, laptops, iPad, etc. in the near vicinity of the Vizio streaming with the Wi-Fi downstairs effortlessly. I finally had to move the modem/router upstairs right next to the Vizio, and now all is well, but from my experience I wouldn't purchase another Vizio for streaming movies (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.) unless is was certain my modem/router was within maybe 40 feet of the Vizio TV.	3.0	September 22, 2015

amazon.com	This is an initial review as I've only had the set for about 3 weeks. I'll evaluate further at a later date.  I don't use the wi-fi as I have a Roku 3 and a Blu Ray player.  Our normal viewing distance is about 10-12'.<br /><br />PICTURE: 5 stars<br />Extremely nice, crisp, bright picture with plenty of settings and flexibility.  Viewing angle is adversely affected at about 30 degrees off center but not significantly until you get to about 45 degrees.  No noticeable lag during sporting events, although there's some halo effect for dark scenes containing light objects. The pre-set picture profiles are exaggerated and cartoonish looking.<br /><br />REMOTE: 3 stars<br />Small and non-differentiated. Not very intuitive with small lettering and markings. Not easily usable if you have large hands. There's very little tactile differentiation between buttons and it's not back lit.<br /><br />MENUS:  3 stars<br />Menus are a bit confusing and counter intuitive. The information box (hit INFO button) is extremely small onscreen and virtually indecipherable from over 6'. The main menus I access are sound and picture and they're not easily usable.<br /><br />SOUND:  1 star<br />Awful sound reproduction which sounds distant- like there's a tinny echo.  For a capable flat screen LED with such wonderful visual capabilities, I shouldn't have to buy a sound bar for decent audio. Why can't TV's have adequate front-facing speakers and a slightly larger bottom bezel to accommodate them?  Hmm??<br /><br />SET:  4 stars<br />Handsome unit, light and unobtrusive.  Not a fan of the splayed feet but understand why they're preferable with larger televisions. Very stable and graceful looking.<br /><br />Overall an extremely well performing picture but failing sound and average menus and remotes.  Hence the 3 star rating...	3.0	September 21, 2015

amazon.com	Great picture quality and very good audio quality. You need to mess around with the picture and especially the audio settings to get things right for u but this tv is great. It's massive and kinda overwhelming. It just barely fits on my table. My last tv was a dinky 19 inch Sansui tv that I bought at Walmart. This tv is almost like looking at a screen displayed from a projector. While I'm very happy with the audio I would definitely recommend some sort of surround sound system. And who doesn't have some sort of a surround sound system by now anyway? That said, the speakers are no where near as bad as some others on here make them out to be.<br /><br />Also very good for gamers. Menu text is very small on a 19 inch tv when using a ps4. :-)	5.0	September 21, 2015

amazon.com	The reviews I scoured before settling on this TV did not lie. It produces a beautiful picture with excellent contrast, impressive blacks (it features effective local dimming!), and perfectly good color (esp. once calibrated). Its refresh rate and motion blur are low, it interpolates well to 120 Hz if one desires it, and being a true 120 Hz panel it can output 24 Hz movies, 30 Hz NTSC content and 60 Hz video games all without duplicating or dropping frames, for flawless smoothness of presentation.<br /><br />I'm sure the built-in speakers are as awful as the reviews all state, but that is as-expected for modern TVs with their extreme flatness. It was heavy enough to be tough for one person to install, but still rather light for its size, which is large enough to give an excellent &#34;big screen&#34; feel.<br /><br />The &#34;smart&#34; features are perfectly usable, if not noticeably exceptional (I don't much use them due to cheap convenient superior alternatives). Though I was rather impressed that it supports GoogleCast (Chromecast) functionality for its apps, so for Netflix and Youtube at least you can use your phone/tablet/pc to queue up content directly.<br /><br />It's biggest weakness might be its somewhat high input latency, which is just barely noticeable for a somewhat sensitive person playing video games in normal picture modes. In its Game Mode however I cease to be aware of it, so most people (even ones very into games) should probably not let that discourage them (it worried me considerably when deciding, and I'm extremely glad I went ahead and got it anyway). Possibly if you're going through a receiver that adds more latency it could be an issue.<br /><br />Bottom Line: After having this a few months, I continue to believe it to be a great TV and an unrivaled value for its quality. Certainly there are alternatives that cost much more and offer some improvements (as well as pricier but still inferior options, I'll wager), but I suspect most people will be extremely happy with this option (including many enthusiasts, like myself).	5.0	September 20, 2015

Scratches on top or sides of item (less than 1&#34; x 1&#34;).&#34; However, the entire right side of TV is cracked, not scratched.  The frame is coming off screen about half way down.  The remote only works when TV is initially plugged in, but stops working after about 10 seconds. The TV is not functional and freezes before we can even do anything on it.  The TV also only turns off when unplugged. The condition of this product is not &#34;good&#34; if we can't even use it!	1.0	September 19, 2015
amazon.com	tl;dr- bad commodity television; avoid<br /><br />The picture is the definition of &#34;washed out&#34;.  No vibrancy to the colors, certainly not an exciting picture.<br /><br />After a month it locks up.  Can't change the volume, channel, input or settings.  Vizio says I have to pay for it to be sent to their warranty repair - a cost of over 100 dollars.  This TV now costs over 600 bucks plus the time wasted without it working.<br /><br />I don't care how good a product claims to be.  If the warranty support is not behind it- then good luck.  I'll never buy Vizio again, and I'll warn my friends/family.	1.0	September 19, 2015

amazon.com	I initially bought a similarly priced Samsung 32&#34; 1080p Smart TV for the bedroom.<br /><br />We wanted a Smart TV for Netflix and Amazon without having to rent another cable box. The Samsung remote required several button presses at times to get an action. It also had a significant lag time from start up to being able to access the network. The lag time is similar to a 2010(ish) LG we have in the living room, if not even slower. It was painful for a $300+ TV so we ended up returning it and went to BB to play with their 32-40&#34; TV's.<br /><br />This Vizio stood out immediately on price. It loads the network quickly, the remote is easy to use, and the picture is just as good as the Samsung. It's no wonder to me why this TV has a 4.5 star rating here on Amazon. It was marginally more expensive than it's Samsung 32&#34; counterpart and leagues better in performance. Very happy with this TV.	5.0	September 14, 2015

No longer in the Amazon return policy, I had to call the Vizio phone#, rep was nice and not much holding time.  Apparently it is not a repairable problem.<br /><br />Vizio will replace the TV with a refurbished one, however, it will take over 10 days to even get a phone call from the people who will receive the TV to then wait again to have it delivered.  Not thrilled.	3.0	September 14, 2015

Thoroughly enjoying the Amazon Prime app making it hard to stay away from the TV.  Have not had that much luck with hooking up facebook, however.  I still need to do some experimenting with this set, but so far so good	5.0	September 13, 2015
amazon.com	I needed a TV for my office and bought this Vizio.  I took off a star because the picture doesn't seem very sharp, and it also seems dark despite adjusting brightness to full, which I have never come close to on any other TV set I have owned.  Still, for the price under $200, it does the job and I am pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />I have several old CRT TVs which still work great and it isn't hard to find people giving away their CRTs because even charities no longer accept them.  &#34;You can have it if you just come get it&#34;, so price was an issue with me because I could easily have gotten another CRT TV free and I think the picture quality exceeds many new TVs.  However I didn't want a TV to dominate my office,  and they are heavy and difficult to move without help. I wanted to be able to move it and it occurred to me that I could use a flat screen TV as an monitor as well, although I haven't tried to hook it up to a computer yet.  I found it easy to hook up, small enough so it doesn't dominate the room and easy to move from shelf to my desk.  I have clear reception via a small $15 antenna, and the smart TV features like Netflix/Hulu are easy to use and access.	4.0	September 13, 2015

amazon.com	This TV is a steal for the price. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the picture and the audio. I was looking for a moderate sized TV for my dorm room, mainly for gaming and Netflix. The smart TV feature of this is awesome and easy to operate. The setup is quick and easy. It's exactly what I was looking for and I am happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great picture quality for the size and price.<br />Light and easy to transport.<br />The Smart applications function very well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Connection between the remote and the TV while using an internet function can be unsteady. (I'm not sure if this is applicable to the wi-fi connection speed, but I've noticed on occasion while watching Netflix if I change the volume with the remote there will be a delayed response with the TV.<br /><br />DOES NOT come with an HDMI, just take note of that in case you were expecting one.<br /><br />There is no area on the back of the TV to secure it with a wall anchor cable or anything similar to that. You either need to use the feet it comes with on a flat surface or hang the TV with a wall mount. I was expecting somewhere I could anchor the TV in case it were to tip over, but that's not the case.<br /><br />There are no buttons on the set itself so everything has to be controlled with the remote.<br /><br />For video games, you will want to turn off the Clear Action setting on the refresh rate, otherwise you might have some odd stuttering of the picture.<br /><br />The set does not support 5.0 ghz band connection which ultimately means a slightly slower connection. However, this is subjective and all depends on the power of your internet itself. 2.4 ghz with a good upload and download speed, should result in no issues with streaming.<br /><br />Final conclusion: Great TV for a student living in a dorm or apartment, also would be great for a guest room. Just big enough to provide a nice view of the picture and the full HD picture quality is very nice. I highly recommend this TV, it's a bargain.	4.0	September 12, 2015

amazon.com	I actually thought there would be app download capability on this TV.  However, to my surprise, there isn't any way to download available free apps from the internet...only from Yahoo! and the majority of those are local cable affiliates that are not even close to my area (wouldn't get app if local).  This is very disappointing.  My fault for not doing proper due diligence.<br /><br />Pleased with the picture, but the sound is not worth the cost of the TV.  I'd hate to suspect that Vizio purposely has very poor quality sound requiring you to purchase a sound bar to enhance the sound quality.<br /><br />Overall, very disappointed and would NOT recommend this TV to anyone!	2.0	September 12, 2015
amazon.com	Bought it to upgrade my girl from her 19&#34; Vizio and man, was THAT an upgrade. Way better interface. Way better control during apps (Her old Tv, you couldn't filter prime videos on Amazon, and if you did, it just listed movies and you had to keep hitting a &#34;next button&#34;. No search option and if you searched, it would make you pay for the video even if Prime DID cover it). Everything works flawlessly. It's nice and big. The detail is superb. I hooked my Xbox One up to it and it looks AMAZING. She is super happy to have this TV and she enjoys it. I even like the new remote. But a I Love Heart Radio button? Really? Who's idea was that? Hold this L.<br /><br />Oh and they have SPOTIFY ON IT!	5.0	September 11, 2015

amazon.com	I have had this TV for a month now. The picture is very nice and I think very realistic. We watch a lot of tennis, golf and cycling and it is almost like being at the event. I did have to adjust the picture setting to get this result. Fortunately there are a ton of setting you can change. I had the Vizio and a Scepter tv from Walmart and decided on the Vizio. The pictures on both were good but it was like seeing a acrylic versus a watercolor painting. I preferred the watercolor. I did get a refurbished Vizio soundbar because we also watch a lot of British Shows and this helped with the dialog. I also got the 4 year service plan from Square Deal mainly for my own peace of mind. I feel like this is a very good value.	5.0	September 11, 2015

amazon.com	Wonderful for video, really impressive, but DO NOT BUY if you plan on trying to use it as a computer monitor too. I bought the 65&#34; thinking it would display chroma 4:4:4 based on the rtings.com review and spent a lot of wasted time trying to get it to work. RT got 4:4:4 working on the the 60&#34; version but this did NOT work for me with the 65&#34; and i tried everything, even getting a new video card. Nothing worked and i instead had to buy another set to use for a dedicated PC monitor.<br /><br />I've read a lot of people complain that the TV does a poor job on upconverting low res cable to 1080p and i have to agree. The TV itself does a poor job, but if i let the Tivo do the upscaling even lower res cable looks great. I liked this set so much for video i bought 55&#34; LG TV just for a computer monitor.. for the price i paid for both i do not think i could have gotten one single set that will handle each task as well as just having the two sets i bought. I did get an amazing price for both sets, and used some Amazon credit, otherwise this wouldnt have worked.	5.0	September 11, 2015

amazon.com	This is a great TV without a doubt, picture quality is very good especially after you tweak it a bit. A great feature is the audio digital out which delivers bitstream regardless of source so the receiver can decode whatever comes in. My [more expensive] Samsung cannot do this and delivers only PCM or DTS:Neo for the apps like Netflix etc.<br />Having the 2 feet make it more stable for such a big screen if you dont wall mount and the small frame looks really good. The remote is not the best with no backlight and squishy buttons but I used a Harmony universal remote anyway so no biggie for me. I got this for a family member and wish I had kept this one and given them the Samsung which says it all really.	4.0	September 10, 2015

amazon.com	This is a great TV at the Amazon price.  I found this TV at store locations at a similar price but I had no way to take it home myself.  For about an extra $50, Amazon delivered the TV to my home in a 3 hour window within 2 days.  I was very happy with that service.  After mounting the 65in TV to the wall, about 5 hours into watching it, the TV screen went black.  I could hear sound, but there was nothing on the screen.  I originally called VIZIO for tech support and they told me that they were going to replace my TV and the delivery would be 7-10 business days.  I got tired of waiting and I contacted Amazon to see what they could do, and they agreed to replace my TV and would have another one to my house for a swap in 2 days!  I was very happy with the service that Amazon gave me for that.  I've had the TV now for about a 5 days and I like it a lot.  I highly recommend this TV if you want a large LED TV at a great price.  Hopefully my original TV was just a lemon.	4.0	September 10, 2015

amazon.com	I had to give this 3 stars out of 5 due to the fact that the first unit we received was defective/damaged.  Otherwise, this would be a 5 star review, as we love the replacement unit we received, especially considering the price.<br /><br />The first unit had severe light leaks at the corners of the screen (either defective or caused by damage during shipping).<br /><br />We ordered a replacement, and the replacement is fantastic so far.  There are no light leaks and all of the functions we've tried have worked perfectly.  We frequently use Netflix, which works great, we also use it to watch Blu-ray (via HDMI), Apple TV (via HDMI), and Cable via component.  There are some nice hidden functions that I didn't expect from an 'inexpensive' TV like the ability to name inputs, fairly advanced picture settings/modes, and even an equalizer for audio.<br /><br />I will say that the one area that this TV hasn't wow-ed us is in the audio department.  It just doesn't sound great, but we're using the TV speakers and I don't expect to get much out built-in TV speakers anyways.	3.0	September 8, 2015

amazon.com	I am sorry that I bought this TV, after having a Panasonic 42 inch with a crystal sharp picture, I ordered this TV because<br />Panasonic is manufactured in Venezuela, I decided to buy this product, and I am very upset with the picture, it is dull and I would not advise<br />anyone to purchase it. I'm also on direct tv and had technihions in to check my dish, the tv is a terrible buy.	1.0	September 6, 2015

amazon.com	Depending on the light in the room, be prepared to spend a good amount of time adjusting the picture settings. I've had mine wall mounted for about 3 weeks now and I'm still making minor tweaks here and there. But over all, I'm really happy with the tv. I previously had a 50' vizio D-series, that touted a 120hz &#34;effective refresh rate&#34; and this 65&#34; E-series lists a 240hz &#34;effective refresh rate&#34;. If you do your research you'll know that's not the native refresh for either of these sets. This set has 120hz native refresh rate and it shows! The picture is really amazing. Action sequences are processed very well and come through very clear with fast action. The sound, really not so much. Very mid-range and tinny, barely noticeable bass tones. But there's no getting around that with these flat panels. So definitely plan on a sound bar or surround sound set up with this tv. I'm happy I went with the E65-c3. It's a really great picture. Very very satisfied.	5.0	September 6, 2015
amazon.com	Very pleased with this.  Does all I hoped it would. Vizio support efficiently assisted me with internet set up.  The picture froze a couple of times when I had it on mute and released the mute button requiring I turn it off and on again.  This hasn't occurred again for past couple of weeks.	4.0	September 5, 2015

amazon.com	this tv is awesome especially for what you pay for it. I already had another larger sized vizio but it is a ccfl older style lcd hdtv and I wanted a new gaming tv that has low input lag which this one I've seen tested at 29ms input lag which is the time from when you hit the button on your game controller to when it registers on screen and 29ms is exceptional.my other tv is around the 100ms mark so I got big improvement, also I wanted a higher contrast ratio.This tv looks great nice black levels and and nice detail in the dark scenes due to the high contrast ratio. the only negative I've experienced with this tv is a little led backlight bleed on the bottom left of the screen. I highly recommend!	4.0	September 5, 2015

amazon.com	Descent remote, setup easy, sound good.  But...picture brightness self adjusts while room lighting is the same.  Some TV's will self adjust the picture brightness based on the ambient room lighting.  This vizio tweaks its brightness up and down even though the room lighting stays the same.  Using satellite and over the air HD, wall mounted.<br /><br />*Review Update: Thanks to a helpful suggestion from Zartan I tweaked the settings controlling the backlighting.  there is no longer any issues with the auto brightness self adjusting. rating  Bumped from two to now five stars.	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	I was considering buying a Samsung Smart TV because our family has bought Samsung in the past and has been very happy with them. But I went ahead and bought this Vizio because Amazon ranked it as the #1 Bestseller. I can now see why!!! This is a fabulous TV!!  I was a little concerned because of some of the somewhat negative reviews I've read about the Vizio from other customers on this customer review, but let me reassure anyone considering this TV.  It has a beautiful picture, the sound is fine and I can go to Netfix directly at the push of a button!! It looks elegant in my TV cabinet, sleek and classy looking. I'm so happy I got this TV!!! Don't hesitate!! Plus it's about $40.00 less expensive than the Samsung. And.......it's light as a feather! Love it!!!!! Great TV!!!!!!	5.0	September 3, 2015

amazon.com	It bothers me that this TV talkes a while to turn on. When I hit the power button, nothing happens for awhile and makes me question if I missed the button. Then finally some text appears on a black screen saying it can't find a signal (I have netflix and no Cable) so I hit netflix or amazon buttons and it thinks some more before going to the site. It's a bit irksome because my other tv was instantaneous with this. Also, I am bothered that Pandora is not an option on this tv. There is a button for I Heart Radio which I just don't like as much as Pandora. Otherwise, the screen is nice and image is sharp.	3.0	September 2, 2015

I only use Netflix and Amazon and HBO GO so love how easy it is to access those apps.	4.0	September 1, 2015

amazon.com	Had this TV for about 3 weeks now and I will say that I am very satisfied. Few things about this TV that I want to point out:<br /><br />-This TV has an on button and that's it. No volume, no Channel buttons, so if/when you eventually lose the remote, you will be screwed atleast until you replace it. I've gone on 30 minute hunting trips for this remote especially when I move this TV to the room. The remote is pretty small and slick, which isnt really a complaint in itself, but for some reason it's really easy to lose.<br /><br />-This is a good TV if you are going to be moving it around, either transporting it between rooms, to someone else's house, etc. It's extremely lightweight, as noted by the UPS guy. When moving to the living room, it looks a bit small, like you could have gone up a size or two, but when moved to a bedroom it's a very good size. You could probably get away with a 40&#34; in the room, but it would not be as smooth for transporting, so if that's what you're going to be doing this is a very good choice.<br /><br />-I was not to keen on the feet of the television when ordering and would have much preffered a one stand base. Having owned it for 3 weeks now, I can say they are unexpectedly sturdy. If a having a base stand vs feet is a concern of yours like it was for me, I  can tell you it hasn't made much of a difference in my experience.<br /><br />-The speakers. The sound is the absolute bottom of the barrel, which is pretty much expected with most of all TVs with speakers on the back panel. However, remember what you're buying. This is a good budget TV for the the price but if you are an audio snob like me you will eventually have to buy a sound bar or some kind of speaker set.<br /><br />-The 1080p content is very crisp. The edge lit dimming looks somewhat odd if you are looking at it from the side(mostly on dark background). Almost thought my TV was busted the first time I noticed this. In this sense it kind of mimics a computer or laptop monitor. It looks completely fine when sitting in front.<br /><br />-Bought this TV for gaming and I must say this is probably the best aspect of the TV. All the game mode does is alter with the brightness, contrast etc settings, just like you can change to calibrated or vivid movies, and they even have have a computer setting.  The lag is very minimal on this TV in fact I can't say I've noticed any at all, making it exceptionally good for online gaming.<br /><br />-the Smart aspect of this TV leaves much to be desired. The apps, are very basic,  only ones of any real value being Netflix, Hulu plus and the Radio apps. There's is pretty much nothing there when it comes to apps and it doesn't look like they'll be adding more anytime soon. If you're buying it for this feature you'll probably have to invest in a Roku/chromecast/fire stick at some point if you want to get the most out of the &#34;Smart&#34; experience.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, although I was probably going to be satisfied in some fashion regardless since I am upgrading from an old CRT. I can't in good conscious give this review 5/5 because of the sound, but if that doesn't bother you very much or are planning to upgrade the sound or already have speakers, for $250 this is probably the best deal you're going to find honestly.	4.0	September 1, 2015

amazon.com	I just purchased this TV from Costco last night. If anything of substance changes, I'll take the time to post an update.<br /><br />Things worthy of note:<br />- It is much more convenient to be able to watch digital media directly on the TV than it is to have a Roku, Chromecast or Wii. It's easy and streamlined. I was hesitant about it using the Yahoo! Apps but it seems to be OK. Decent selection of apps. You do need to have Spotify Premium to use Spotify on this TV.<br />- My remote came with the three programmed buttons of Amazon Instant, Netflix and iHeartRadio. Obviously I would prefer them to be Netflix, Hulu Plus and HBOGo, but I suppose that you can't please everyone. It would have been nice if you can reprogram them to your desired channels.<br />- BIG CON: There is a buzzing noise that comes from our TV when it's on. It's quiet enough that you don't hear it when you're watching anything with sound, but when there isn't sound, it can be heard even from the other room. This might be a defect with my...

amazon.com	It has a great picture quality, especially for the price. I mean it really has amazing picture quality. The thing to keep in mind though, is the sound is terrible. I don't mean that its bad, I mean that I would rather turn the sound off of the TV and have none than use the sound that comes out of the built in speakers. Its a good thing I have a home theater setup and never have used the sound from the TV for more than a couple seconds. So really buy it for the picture, but find something else to generate your sound.	4.0	September 1, 2015
amazon.com	Bought the 65 inch about 2 weeks ago. The top part of the screen was slightly dented allowing sections of white glowing backlight to be visible. Amazon immediately sent me a new one and took away the old one- no questions asked. They assigned a customer service rep who called me daily to let me know of progress with the shipper and the installer (bought Dish installation for on wall mounting). The first delivery company screwed up with delivery scheduling and Dish did the same thing with the install date. For putting up with all of this crap Amazon gave me a credit. I am a lifelong Amazon Prime member. Can you imagine if every company you dealt with treated you with such respect? This is my 3rd Vizio- I have a 55 and a 60 that I bought 2 years ago.The TV is a terrific buy for the price. I am not a super finicky electronics consumer and I think the picture is great and there's a lot of flexibility to fine tune for your definition of accuracy. They have significantly upgraded the Amazon instant video interface from the older sets. The remote is flimsier than prior versions and doesn't have a keyboard on the back. This is a solid TV and I recommend it- a lot of screen for a little money.	5.0	September 1, 2015

I consider this TV a great bargain and would not hesitate to recommend it to any of my friends.	5.0	August 31, 2015

It is convenient that the remote has a Netflix button built into it as that is what I mostly use with this TV.	4.0	August 30, 2015
amazon.com	As a stand alone television, the picture quality is very good, it has a decent selection of picture modes (I personally keep it on gaming mode), the apps are not all that great because they are slow and such, but in a pinch are great in case you have to move it somewhere. The television is light weight in case you have to move it, it has mounting holes on the back which is good for couch enthusiasts, I don't really mind the reflective screen and glossy finish seeing as i hardly need to touch the television itself. The speakers are terrible, I suggest you buy some from a third party.<br /><br />As a computer monitor, it changes. The viewing angles up close are not that good, the edges disappear, the response time is a little bad for those into competitive shooters, but the picture quality is beautiful. Warning it may give you a headache the first day, but that will eventually go away. Discoloration is not very noticeable and when put on gaming mode, it makes it easier to look at for long periods of time.	3.0	August 30, 2015

amazon.com	Great TV for the money. CNET's recommendation led us to this model and we couldn't be happier. The picture quality is highly customizable, even setting multiple custom profiles. The sound is predictably poor, but who in their right mind wouldn't get at least a sound bar? (All the reviews decrying the sound as justification for a two star rating are bull anyways.) The smart TV apps work, nothing to write home about, but usable. They'll probably duplicate (be rendered obsolete) by any XBOX/Playstation/ChromeCast/AppleTV/FireStick/Roku device you have. But if you're not in the market to buy any of those things, then the smart TV apps are great.	5.0	August 30, 2015

amazon.com	It worked out of the box and the picture quality was excellent. I selected this despite some very harsh negative reviews because it was the right size for a small TV in a spare bedroom. Setting up WiFi was a chore. Even though other devices could read my home wireless access point from this room, this TV struggled to find it. After repeated tries and much wasted time it finally connected and I launched Netflix to try it out. After a few minutes the connection was lost and could not be restored. Trying to play a DVD using the component connection worked for a while and then it just stopped. The set powered itself down and would not come back on with the remote or the single on-button on the back. The instructions for troubleshooting were limited and it was not worth the time and effort to try and make it work. It had only been out of the box for only a few hours when I called Amazon to return it. This was my first experience with Vizio and it was disappointing to say the least. I've ordered another Samsung TV that is a brand that I have used and trusted for years and would highly recommend over the Vizio.	1.0	August 28, 2015

amazon.com	TV arrived on time.  It's working reasonably well for now.  It likes to disconnect from WI-FI, so that's a bother, but workable.  I was hoping I would get points for the purchase but apparently not.  TV manuals (most manuals, actually) don't match the set or don't tell enough.  I am somewhat computer and electronics savvy but still would appreciate better and more complete directions..  I hope to be better satisfied as time goes by and expect I will be since most others who made this same purchase seem happy.	4.0	August 28, 2015

amazon.com	I love this TV! The price is great. Although there is a couple minor issues some of wich occurred in my other 2 Vizio TVs. Every time I turn the volume up the brightness changes but goes back. Sometimes when you adjust the picture settings it doesnt save. For example if you put the black detail on low a day later it will change to high. I thought it was just the 43 inch E series smart TV I bought but it happened with the 43 inch D series and the 32 inch E series I bought. Other than that slight annoyance the TV is great and I recommend it.	4.0	August 28, 2015
amazon.com	Excellent unit for the price. Smart software includes Netflix and Amazon Prime which is a huge plus for me! The picture quality is excellent and rivals that of my more expensive Sharp Aquos. I did plenty of research before purchasing this unit and its pretty much universally agreed that this TV is one of the top LED TV's under $1000. If you are looking for a second TV in the bedroom or an office for watching TV shows and movies this is the perfect unit for you. I also purchased the 5 year warranty no reason not to with a TV. As a prime member I received the TV within 2 business days and shipping was free. If you don't have prime you are missing out! Once again great TV for the price!	5.0	August 28, 2015
amazon.com	So So disappointed! Thought I read everything but missed the part where the only apps you can run are Yahoo apps!! We have a subscription to CBS all access & Feelin but are unable to run them as Yahoo doesn't offer them. Was thinking I wouldn't need our ROKU and an extra remote but was very wrong...thinking of returning the TV. Of course I am the dummy for not catching the Yahoo thing so make sure that is all you want to stream but the apps kinda suck just an FYI. The TV is nice and the picture but the smart part is not so smart!	3.0	August 27, 2015

amazon.com	I ordered this TV about a week ago and I have been using it for a few days now.<br />Pros: The picture quality is good, with no noticeable bleed in the corners.<br />I have not tested the sound with major base or high pitches, but it sounds fairly crisp for listening to music.<br />The base was incredibly easy to set up.<br />Light and stable<br /><br />Cons: Few inputs<br />Lack of control buttons on the TV itself<br />You have to mess around with it for a while to really learn how to use all the smart features. This is because there are some bugs with which the instruction guide is unhelpful, like accessing the &#34;My Apps&#34; screen on a wired connection.	4.0	August 27, 2015

amazon.com	Great PC monitor, I prefer to have a large screen for my design needs as a graphic designer, the addition of a wall mount and dual screening into my 48 inch Vizio right next to it also on the wall makes it a virtually flawless environment in which I can work and feel right at home. Now the TV side is neat, the wifi is responsive, but I really use it mostly for designing and killing the crap out of digital creatures on destiny or something on the ps4... At the price I'm hella tempted to buy one and have it on back up or replace another workstation, lol these are awesome fellas or ladies who desire more than just a smart TV .	2.0	May 1, 2015
amazon.com	I've only been using this TV for a few days but so far it has been great. Its connected to my Apple TV and the picture quality of this TV is extremely high.

amazon.com	The TV is so dark. I've tried tweaking it and using several modes but they're all SO DARK and it hardly changes with the  adjustments.<br />Otherwise I guess it's an ok TV. I don't have cable because who bothers with that anymore? So the netflix and Amazon buttons on the top are nice but there is also an I heart radio one which is strange. There are a lot of apps that I didn't know anyone used like yahoo stuff... Haven't tried to add any yet because I can't figure out how. Hopefully HBO has an app soon that can work on here too.	2.0	August 26, 2015

Not sure if there is a firmware update coming that will fix that, but I hope so. I also have a previous generation 49&#34; M series that I enjoy. This new E series is almost to the same quality picture. Happy with my purchase so far.	4.0	August 25, 2015

I just purchased this 40&#34; 2 weeks ago, so I'll be writing an updated review in a year or so.<br />  So far this 40&#34; model looks great, setup was quick and simple and I'm very satisfied with its picture quality.<br />  The only SIGNIFICANT disappointment is with the AUDIO design.  For some unfathomable reason Visio placed the speakers in the REAR of the TV!  HUH?  Now I'm shopping for a sound bar so I don't have to listen to the ridiculously placed rear-facing speakers.	4.0	August 24, 2015

amazon.com	This TV is not only the best I've used of the new 2015 models, but the specs it has for input lag, motion blur, and contrast ratio blow other TV's out the water. I purchased this model (E50-C2) from SamsClub/Walmart for about 480 without tax, which includes 90 days to return/exchange.<br /><br />My favorite features:<br />-Colors are accurate, punchy, and vibrant<br />-Backlight is very bright, resists a lot of reflections<br />-Netflix/Amazon buttons on remote, plenty of included applications<br />-Easy to navigate settings<br />-Wifi/LAN connections<br />-Multiple visual settings that control black levels, auto brightness, refresh rate (for each input)<br />-Automatic renaming of inputs, so instead of seeing HDMI 1 you would see &#34;Playstation 3&#34; or &#34;Cable Box&#34;<br /><br />I really don't want to have to name flaws, as they are minimal. but here are some:<br />-Gray colors can look dirty, but only on fully gray screens (like the boot screen)<br />-No motion interpolation (motion smoothing)<br />-240hz setting flickers too much<br />-Colors can be weird/choppy when used as a computer monitor<br /><br />Here are the specs that I went off: http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-brand/vizio/e-series-2015<br /><br />Overall, I can't think of a better price-per-inch TV with these specs for gaming.<br />If this TV lasts more than 2 years, It would suffice. Although I would hope it lasts for 4+ years.	5.0	August 24, 2015
amazon.com	Didn't buy the TV from Amazon but rather a large retailer for a better price.. Overall the TV is a good value, however be aware of two issues and one observation I discovered over the past two days of owning it.<br />1. Once you are connected to the internet, it can take up to a day for the TV to update it's firmware for a stable ability to download apps and content. Until that happens, the TV will tell you that you are not connected to the internet.<br />2. I have this TV hooked up to a Comcast DTA (analog) receiver in the bedroom for basic cable. Others have complained about the picture brightness fading in and out for no reason, I think it's a problem with the &#34;Auto backlight&#34; feature where the TV tries to adjust the picture contrast based on the video feed. Since I have a lower quality feed, I think this is causing very dramatic changes in contrast and brightness using this feature, however you can turn that feature off (Auto Backlight) in the &#34;Pictures&#34; menu (under more options). Ever since I turned that feature off the picture has been stable.<br />Observation: TV does not seem to have an &#34;auto brightness&#34; feature which will dim the screen in lower light conditions.. Not a showstopper however I do miss that feature from my old TV.	4.0	August 24, 2015
amazon.com	I wish I could give this product less than one star. DO NOT buy this &#34;product&#34; from Vizio. If youve read any of the other reviews on here, youll notice that a lot of people have the same problems with the tv. Unfortunately im no exception. The remote is unresponsive, the power button on the tv doesnt work, and if I try to use netflix at all, the Tv crashes. their tech support is a joke, and overall this was NOT worth the money. If any other device is connected at the same time as the tv, it wont work. Dont waste your money. please. Although face value this television looks nice, as soon as you connect to the internet it becomes a quick waste of space. Will  not be buying from vizio again. Really, not even being bitter. This just isnt a good piece of technology. Go for a Samsung. On top of all this, it doesnt even recognize the signal of my playstation.	1.0	August 24, 2015

amazon.com	I bought this tv specifically for watching Netflix in by bedroom.  It had to be a smart tv because I don't have a cable box.  I can listen to stand up comedy and still get ready for work.  I really like this tv, but the first one I received stopped working after a few days.  I could tell it was turning on, but the screen was blank, I couldn't even get the menu to come up.  I called Amazon and they took me through few steps to reboot the tv and remote, nothing worked.  Amazon sent me a new tv in a couple of days and I returned the broken tv using the new box (since I had recycled the old box).  I didn't have to pay for shipping.  The new tv works great (I hope I didn't jinx it).  I know that sometimes the products I buy may turn out to be &#34;lemons&#34;, but Amazon stepped up and made me happy.  Thanks Amazon.  I've been a customer for many years and I'll be one for many more.	4.0	August 21, 2015

amazon.com	I was a bit disappointed in the Vizio E-50.  I have four Vizio TVs and have liked all but this last one. I feel the clarity of picture is not as good as our other Vizios. Also the base speaker seems to have an irritating cracking/vibrating noise at times. I would only give this product a 3 out of 5 recommendation.<br /><br />The cracking/vibrating noise is continuing and driving me nuts.....does someone know how to contact Visio to see if I can get a replacement???	3.0	August 20, 2015
amazon.com	I would give this 0 stars if possible.  I bought the TV and it worked great for 2 weeks before breaking.  The TV will only power on using the remote (the power button on the back doesn't work) but no other keys will work.  I can't change the input using the remote or the button on the back nor can I use any of the functions of the TV- it's essentially stuck on the current input.  Bear in mind this is after just 2 weeks of use.  I called Vizio support for a new TV and they agreed to ship a new TV out.  However, 20 days after the initial request, I have yet to receive the TV.  Vizio says they outsource the delivery and are no longer taking responsibility for the delivery.  I tracked the package using their number and it has been in my city for the past 10 days, but I've gotten no call for a delivery.  I've been calling Vizio all week and they keep saying &#34;call back in 24-48 hours for an update&#34; every time I call.<br /><br />Bottom Line- TV crapped out in 2 weeks and Vizio hasn't delivered a replacement.	1.0	August 20, 2015

amazon.com	Watch out, this TV doesn't work with a lot of WiFi networks due to being unable to enter a password greater than 22 characters.  The support solution of &#34;use a shorter password&#34; is ridiculous, and not always possible depending on your circumstances.<br /><br />There are some things you can do:<br /> - The TV supports WPS, so enable WPS on your access point/router momentarily.  This allows the TV connect and get the key without having to type it in the GUI.<br /> - Create a separate SSID for your TV, if you have an access point/router that can do this.<br /> - Plug directly in via Ethernet (if possible in your installation, this is the best option anyway)<br /> - Buy a WiFi bridge or AP that you can put into client mode and plug it into the Ethernet jack, letting the bridge communicate wirelessly.	2.0	August 20, 2015
amazon.com	So far this TV has been working great. No problem setting it up and it was mounted over the fireplace easily. The 3 HDMI ports are easy to get to and the Vizio apps have been working great so far. I would recommend this TV for anyone looking for a modest priced option for a family or rec room. The picture quality is good and the remote is small but functional.	5.0	August 20, 2015

amazon.com	The TV has fantastic Picture Quality, Decent Sound and just the right size for a Small Bedroom to watch Movies, Play Video Games and more! It's a 'Smart TV', so it even comes with Apps and direct Wi-Fi Access! That's it for the good news. The down side is, for starters, there is an unexplainable lag in response between the time you click a button on the Remote and the TV responding to that click. It's very annoying, but if you're really patient, you can adjust to it. You shouldn't have to though, because no other TV has ever been that way from my experience. Also, after about 6 Weeks, the sound started popping in & out (While playing my PS3 via HDMI), but only when playing certain games, it seemed. It was so annoying, that I restarted my PS3 twice thinking that the problem was with either it or the HDMI Cable. Well.. I have to wonder no more. About 10 minutes ago, I was in the process of shutting down my PS3, because the TV started making a High-Pitched Whistling noise that I couldn't fathom the source nor cause of. I didn't know at the time whether it was my PS3 or the TV doing this, so I was shutting them both down one at a time to find out. Lo-And-Behold! It was the TV! How did I find this out? Because as soon as I stood next to it, I smelled and then saw Smoke billowing out of the back of it! 😱 Yes! 😳 Smoke! I unplugged it altogether, and the High-Pitched Whistling came to a screeching halt! (I don't know WHY my Smoke Detectors didn't start blasting, considering I can't boil water on the stove without them acting as though my home suddenly because a Towering Inferno!) Anyway, this beautifully designed, sturdily crafted, fantastic picture producing, decent (Virtual) Surround Sound making TV is a bust. Don't buy unless you're feeling lucky. &#34;Well... Do ya?... Punk?&#34; (Clint Eastwood reference) 😆&#60;-NOT! I wish I COULD laugh. Amazon can't help me now, so I'm gonna have to deal directly with Vizio.😕 Wish me luck..😢 I can feel the heartache of having to PAY to ship this damned thing off to somewhere in Bagdad to be repaired, already.😭<br /><br />I'd post a photo, but I'm sure you guys don't want to see a nice-looking TV midway into the process of crashing through my Bedroom window anyway, so... There's that. 😑<br /><br />[Update] Vizio has been a real dildo to deal with, but luckily, Amazon has come to my rescue! 😄<br /> I wrote to let Vizio know that their crappy 'customer service' is no longer needed. Amazon.com and their exceptional staff are taking back the TV and giving me a full refund. I've already told Vizio that I'm also going to write an in-depth review letting everyone know about the horrible performance issues (that I've tried to overlook, in favor of the decent picture quality), spontaneous combustion/billowing smoke incident AND the inconsistent, self-contradictory, counter-productive 'customer service' that followed. I'm doing so as a warning to anyone else who's EVEN CONSIDERING buying a Vizio product of ANY type, so save them from the horrid experience that I've had to endure, which ISN'T to be expected from a PROFESSIONAL place of business. I'm simply appalled. The TV was smoking like a small incinerator and after being told by Vizio that they were going to get my TV fixed and/or replaced, I'm suddenly given the MIDDLE FINGER??!! 😠😡😤	1.0	August 19, 2015

amazon.com	I just received my Vizio yesterday.  The product was delivered on time and in excellent condition though it was delivered via the USPS.  The set up was extremely easy but it was a little tricky for me because I needed coaxial cables (that I did not have but have placed an order for) to hook up a fairly old DVD player (If it ain't broke why replace it...LOL). So for now, I used the audio/video cables that I had.  Nonetheless, setting up the internet/wifi connection was easy because the tv found my network.  I would say, that I am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a great Smart LED HDTV at a great price.	5.0	August 18, 2015

While the other did match or slight beat in overall picture, the design, feet that hold, ports design and number of inputs, apps, and sound are much better. The sound in particular is far better than the Samsung which is important on 32 inch that isn't getting hooked up to a home theater.

This remote is almost the best I've ever used. Lots of inputs and processor is extremely fast. I've never lost a wi fi signal for the smart tv and it's the fastest buffer I've seen besides my laptop computer. Assembles the stands in seconds, (Besides plugging in the power chords and putting batteries in remote it's all it needed). One Philips screw driver 4 screws and 5 minutes at most it was ready to set up. Registration and set up is an ease and took maybe 5 mins. I have the same TV only LCD a year older.

amazon.com	***DO NOT BUY THIS TV!***<br />As other people have noted, this TV set 'pulses' in brightness, going from bright to very dim and back again, every 5 to 20 seconds; it's variable. IT MAKES THE TV  ***COMPLETELY UNWATCHABLE***. Sometimes it goes very dim, and stays that way for several minutes. So you adjust the brightness to near maximum, only to have it suddenly start to get brighter and brighter and brighter again. Vizio 'tech support' was absolutely worthless. They wanted me to ship the brand new TV at MY EXPENSE to them for 'repair'.<br /><br />ALSO: the picture on 480 SD (standard definition) is just HORRIBLE. It's like every program is badly out of focus. I couldn't read the credits after a movie.  I have an older 19&#34; Vizio and the picture is really nice, so it's NOT my cable feed. This is just a BAD TV SET.<br /><br />This is a total piece of Chinese JUNK, and it's going back to Amazon tomorrow. What an incredible waste of my time, ordering it, waiting for a WEEK to get it, spending all the time to set it up. Now I have to package it it up and ship this piece of Chinese crap back to Amazon.<br /><br />DO ***NOT*** WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	Sweet set from Visio,  Nice size & set of options, the WiFi works perfectly as advertised, but too bad the media player won't play FLV Flash videos from the USB.  One annoying thing that they promote is the 'auto backlit' for picture quality in all modes.  I turned that OFF,  it was annoying with the brightness fluctuation,  I just set the backlit & brightness & contrast to my custom settings.  Also can't get the headphone jack to work.  But other than that, its a marvel of modern engineering.	4.0	August 10, 2015

amazon.com	Our LG tv went poof while we were watching the news and while it was under an extended warranty, the wait time for a tech was a couple of weeks. We went in search of a replacement and figured we'd put the repaired TV in the bedroom. Shopping for a TV is a difficult thing to do. One review says it's wonderful, another says stay away. We read about light leaks, bleeding color, bad black colors and all these things that in the old days no one had to think about. My parents just chose a screen size and came home with the TV. It's all very complicated now. All we wanted was a 50 inch TV that would give us a good picture and did not break the bank. After reading a lot of reviews, we chose this one because it was inexpensive and opinions were generally very good.<br /><br />It arrived in an outer box filled with packing materials that were triangular shaped pieces of cardboard. After we took the TV out of the large, outer box, our cat ran in there and treated it like a bounce house kicking and jumping all over the pieces. I was able to easily lift the TV, put it on the entertainment center and connect everything. We changed the display to Dynamic (I think) and made a few adjustments to individual settings and are very pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind: Many TVs have the stand in the center so are only limited by the size of your entertainment center. What I mean is, if you have a 40 inch wide object with a 20 inch stand in the center, you could get away with putting it on a 24 inch tabletop because the entire stand would be accommodated. This television has the feet on the extreme edges so make sure you measure the width of your TV stand before ordering to ensure it fits.	5.0	August 10, 2015

amazon.com	The delivery: I purchased it on Wednesday using Prime -expecting it on Friday- instead wasn't delivered until Wednesday (Tuesday first attempt).<br /><br />The packaging: The box showed the usual amount of wear that you'd expect - Corners rounded, some sides badly scraped. But I was displeased to find two corners of styrofoams badly damaged to the point where I began to wonder what kind of damage the TV might've incurred during shipping.<br /><br />The packaging II: The screen panel on lower right side had multiple, noticeable scratches. This infuriated me. The panel is the end result of what's inside the TV. No matter how late and superior technology the TV utilizes, if panel is damaged then it's a fail.<br /><br />The performance: This is my first time buying a HDTV that wasn't Samsung or LG. The price to performance ratio may be comparable to former. But Vizio -at least the one I received- is not up to par with them when it comes to performance. It's just not as clear nor brilliant no matter how much I manipulated the settings.<br /><br />The ease of use & innovative feel: There aren't any. The remote is too simplified to have full control of smart TV functions. It even disappoints watching regular on-air television. This TV doesn't offer TV listings like my previous ones did. The only way to know what's on where is to tune-in to each channel and clicking info.<br /><br />Overall, I'm content with what I got, not overly excited nor upset. This was to complete my mini man-cave, and it definitely served that purpose at a reasonable price. I'll also be replacing my current living room TV soon with a 70&#34; 4K TV. It just won't be a Vizio.	3.0	August 9, 2015

amazon.com	I did not buy my first Vizio smart TV from Amazon mainly because I caught a great deal from a large box store.  However when the new &#34;Black Friday&#34; came about I ran to Amazon to find smart TVs for bedrooms.  These are perfect. Great size for a bedroom, great connectivity to the internet that leads to Amazon Prime. Extremely easy to set up even for this Luddite.  Vizio TVs are the best as far as I am concerned and Amazon hit the ball out of the park with the price.  Bought 2, wish I had bought 4.	5.0	August 8, 2015
amazon.com	I have owned many Vizio products over the years, and have usually been satisfied with their products. This TV is a piece of junk. I ordered it on 7/3/15 and it shipped Prime. I installed it as a replacement to the 17&#34; LCD in our RV, as the outside dimensions are about the same as the old one, but would give us 7 more inches of screen diagonally. Powered up, scanned the channels, and the picture popped up and looked great - for a moment anyway. Right away the remote would work intermittently, but mostly did not work at all. Then, the screen started to intermittently dim, darkening the picture just enough to be annoying. The power button on the TV also did not work. It did, however, connect to the WiFi right away. After a few very annoying days, I called Amazon and they immediately refunded me and sent a return label. I had to go out of town the next day for a month, so my wife sent it back. Amazon sent the new one on 7/12/15, it arrived on the 14th, and it sat there until I returned home today (just shy of a month). I installed it and guess what - SAME EXACT ISSUES and more. This time, the audio did not work. Settings were good, but nothing. Also, it would not display any WiFi networks (there are at least 15 within range of any device in my RV. I do not know how this has achieved a 4.2 star rating. I had two bad ones in a row with multiple identical issues.The aggravation has been the worst part of it. I spend a lot of money on tech products. This have been very disappointing and I will now think twice about buying Vizio products in the future. Amazon customer service, as always, has been super. Vizio support was a joke.	1.0	August 8, 2015

amazon.com	Received the tv, and to be honest, it took longer to get it out of the box than to get it set up and connected to my wifi.  It has great picture quality.  I have it in a relatively smaller living room area and it is approximately 8-10 feet from the couch.  I have not noticed any distinct color or tone loss from any angle I can view the TV from in my room.  The ONLY reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because there is no internet browsing capability on the TV, at least none that I could find.  I was easily able to install and set up my Plex media server, thus allowing me to stream any and all of the media I have on my PC.  I currently have it hooked up to an analog coaxial TV input, and even with that low end video connection, the picture looks great.  I may update once I have a HD input hooked up.	4.0	August 8, 2015
amazon.com	Although the interface is user friendly and there are many great features on this TV, the TV itself is awful.<br />Afte about three months of use the remote is only registered by the TV about 30% of the time so I have to unplug the TV or give up on watching anything, the TV freezes A LOT, the sound is AWFUL (when my A/C is on I have to have to volume on 100% and can still hardly hear it), and the quality for the money is just not worth it.	2.0	August 7, 2015
amazon.com	I bought this TV for my travel trailer.  Trying it out in my office before I pick up the trailer and so far so good.  I'm surprised at the speed of the smart TV features.  Not as fast as Roku 3, but close enough and eons better than my 2012 phillips &#34;smart&#34; TV.  I'm still going to put Chromecast and AppleTV on both of the HDMI ports as well as utilize OTA, but I will likely utilize the Netflix and Amazon Prime video on the smart TV when I want to watch something on those services.  The picture is great and responsive - especially for the low price.  The remote feels a bit cheap compared to other remotes, but its small size and low weight are growing on me.  It is very functional and intuitive.<br /><br />Time will tell if this TV will hold up like my 2006 Sony HDTV has. Giving it 4 out of 5 and will report back over time.	4.0	August 7, 2015

amazon.com	The TV is very good-looking, nice thin bezel, easy to assemble, and very light. Picture quality is definitely sufficient for the price, and I haven't even had time to tweak it manually yet. My first issue is minor, and it is that it does not support a 5.0GHz wireless band, which is what I like to use for my streaming devices.<br /><br />Second though, was that upon selecting picture presets, the back of the TV(not the speakers) started to hum depending on the setting. After playing with it, it appears that the Auto Brightness Control setting is causing the hum to get louder or change tone. Only the Vivid and Computer setting would not hum, and the Auto Brightness Control is set to OFF in those settings, but in all of the others, it is set to low, med, or hi, and the hum becomes louder the higher you get. Turning ON the Auto Brightness Control on Vivid or Computer mode will cause it to start humming again, and weirdly, turning it OFF on the other presets causes it to hum the loudest, no rhyme ...

amazon.com	I purchased this item specifically because I stream a lot of programming over Net Flix and Amazon and the size is perfect for the space in my home office.  The streamed programs buffered too frequently to make viewing enjoyable.  I do not have a problem streaming content on my computer, iPhone or Kindle.  I concluded the problem was with the TV.  I contacted Vizio support via live chat, went through a total reset of the tv as instructed.  I was then  kicked off the live chat because I was evidently on with the technician too long as he said he would have to end the chat session after 3-5 minutes even though I was having work my way through a total reset up process.  The problem was not resolved, and I could not get the screen size to readjust on regular broadcast programs.  I believe I will constantly have problems with this  TV and have decided to return it.  I guess you get what you pay for.	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	Unfortunately, my tv arrived with the screen completely damaged, smashed in somewhere during shipping. When I called Amazon Customer Service, they offered to replace the TV at no cost to me, and have the new TV overnighted. The second TV was WELL PROTECTED inside of another huge box with padding and wrap. When I opened it I was happy to find that it was in excellent condition. It installed and setup super easy. Remote is nice, but I will soon upgrade to the remote with the full keyboard on the back. My USB wireless keyboard works fine for letters, but it does't seem to like me typing numbers. Picture quality looks excellent, and the sound, although it doesn't get cinema loud, sounds as though it has nice depth and clarity.<br /><br />Apps are limited. HBO GO is not available so I suggest owning another &#34;smart&#34; device such as Roku, AppleTV, or a gaming console with more app choices.	5.0	August 6, 2015

However I am EXTREMELY dissapointed that you cannnot label the TV channels nor is there a &#34;favorite channel&#34; feature.  When there are so many channels one now has to memorize the channel number rather than go to a favorite list.  My 8 year old Sony had this.

amazon.com	This TV worked great, for 2 days. Then it just started freezing after you start it and try to execute any menu commands. I called customer service (Vizio) and the troubleshooting steps verified that it was defective. No repairs or replacement options are available for this model, so they've told me I have to send them pictures proving the TV freezes (aren't all pictures frozen?) along with proof of purchase and they'll let me know what's next. I'll update the post once I learn more.<br /><br />My primary mistake: I tossed the box to the TV after a couple of days of it working. If I hadn't, maybe I could have just returned it through the more friendly Amazon method :(<br /><br />**Update: After awaiting a promised call from Vizio that never came, i contacted them and they instructed me to mail them the TV back for a refund . No prepaid shipping or anything. I decided to call Amazon and they were brilliant. Replaced the TV and provided return labels for the busted one!<br /><br />My replacement hasn't had any issues. I suspect that my original froze when I connected it to my PC via the Plex app to use it as a media server. I didn't set that up on my  replacement TV and haven't had any issues. That may not have been the cause, but I thought I'd share in case it helps anyone.	1.0	August 5, 2015

amazon.com	I purchased this television to replace a really old 32&#34; 720p LG screen I purchased when flatscreens first came out.  I used to have my desktop hooked up to the screen so I could watch all of my favorite Amazon shows and movies from the desktop.  One of the features I really liked about this television was the built in access to Amazon and Netflix.  My roommates have a smart tv elsewhere in the house, so I already knew this was going to be useful.  I rarely ever have to turn my computer on to watch anything any more.  I hung this television on the wall across from my bed, so I sit about 14 feet away from the television.<br /><br />I am not an expert on audio/visual equipment.  I have a 10 year old 5 disc CD changer that I use for a sound system, which means I really can't tell you how good the speakers sound.  I can say that I think this TV looks fantastic, but that may be because it's bigger and better than what I replaced it with.  It was very easy to set up all of my accounts, and the remote is easy to navigate.  It was also easy to plug in all of my various accessories.  For the price, it is an excellent buy.	5.0	August 5, 2015

amazon.com	My Wife bought this TV for me on father's day. I've played with it enough...here's my 2 cents...<br /><br />I downgraded my 55' Sony HX750 to the bedroom for it. The VIZIO outperforms the SONY with deeper blacks giving the scenes much more pop and a more realistic feel. I mounted mine so there is never a bad viewing angle. (see pic)<br /><br />I had my doubts getting a VIZIO to begin with. I have a 50' Samsung Plasma when they still cost $3k and the Sony HX750 set me back around 2k. For 900 bucks at Costco and a 2 year warranty, it's worth 5 stars for value.<br /><br />The unit has multitude calibration settings, I use CNET's recommendation and have pretty much left it alone. My biggest disappointment is the skin tones. Is it a deal breaker, nope. On BluRay, I don't see an issue, but on day to day usage, Amazon Prime, or movies from DirecTV, the skin tones have too much punch lacking refinement of faces, nose, etc...it is what it is. This is where my HX750 wins and so does my 7 year old Samsung Plasma. The HX750 gives you excellent skin tones, wrinkles, etc as does the Samsung...The VIZIO gives you a blotch and nothing more. BUT the black production sure is beautiful and watching a movie in pitch black is great! This is where the HX750 lags drastically and even though the Samsung Plasma produces the deepest blacks, it also gets really hot and warms up the room.<br /><br />For value, the TV is worth 5 stars, but for picture quality, it's a good 4. VIZIO takes the playbook from other top end TV manufacturers and puts their own twist, called AFFORDABILITY! To have everything you &#34;want&#34; from a TV, you will have to pay for it, and I'm not in a financially position to drop another 3-4k on a TV. I am very much pleased with the TV.<br /><br />I had my doubts about VIZIO for so many years, but I think with Technology advancing the way it has been recently. I might have just jumped on the VIZIO bandwagon. My next TV will a 70' 4k, but with 4k still in it's toddler stage, why should I invest in it yet? So I'm very happy with a 1080P unit for at least 2 years before moving on up.<br /><br />For those on the fence, jump over, you won't regret it. You will not find a better performing TV in this price range, even up to 1,800.00 range. So save the money, buy 2 32' in VIZIOs and place them in your children's room because that's what my wife did for less than 1,600.00.	4.0	August 4, 2015

amazon.com	I bought this TV for the guest bed room from a local club warehouse. I've always heard great things about VIZIO so I decided to give them a shot. Initially, the TV worked well for my guest the first evening it was set up. The very next morning, the TV was unable to detect any wireless access points. This was rather embarrassing as I bragged about getting the TV especially for them. After an hour with their award winning customer service, they concluded that the TV was faulty and needed repair. That is to say, in less than 24 hrs, the TV broke. They requested I send it in for service but I declined in order to return it since it had been only 24 hours since I bought the TV. I wish my experience with VIZIO was more positive and understand that my problem is likely an isolated incident, but nonetheless, my first and last experience with VIZIO was very poor.	1.0	August 3, 2015
amazon.com	Great TV, No light leaks or hum.<br />TV looks great Netflix and Amazon play with no problems at all.<br />Note: TV doses not support 5Ghz only 2.4Ghz WiFi<br />Out of the box the sound was weak, but went into the sound settings and disabled Surround sound and auto volume level control<br />and the volume got louder.	5.0	August 3, 2015
amazon.com	This is the best TV I've ever owned. So many times these types of TVs' have the worst sound. That's not the case here. My last television had to be hooked up to my stereo all the time (its sound was like a transistor radio). This TV sounds great with the built in speakers. When hooked up to the stereo it sounds even better (and seems to have a powerful output). And of course the picture is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone like me who has limited funds and wants a good television. Well worth the price.	5.0	August 3, 2015
amazon.com	I great TV for me for the price.  I just figured out after I bought the TV how they do TV measurements!  I always thought it was measured length of the TV, but it's the diagonal length!  It is a nice picture, but I don't have HD with my cable, so it is probably better if I had that service too.	5.0	August 3, 2015

amazon.com	This tv is perfect in so many ways the graphics are amazing , especially if you tune it up yourself. I wanted this tv mainly for my xbox one , and it does not disappoint. There is no input lag , no time delay and graphics as i said are 10/10. It was shipped from Arizona to me here in Colorado and it wasn't damaged nor defective. The tv is great size fits perfectly on my stand and the mount is really bad ass. Took 8 days to get here but well worth it.	5.0	August 3, 2015

amazon.com	Less than impressed with this television.  I've had it now for a few months and the picture quality  goes white when viewed from an angle, sound quality is marginal, and the app selection is very limited (Yahoo apps mostly- and they are useless).  Remote is basic and cheap feeling.  Would not recommend this tv to my friends or family other than to put in a spare bedroom.  1st Vizio was great, 2nd Vizio was great, however this Vizio...not so much.	3.0	August 2, 2015

amazon.com	I needed to finally join the decade and get rid of my very fat back TV and buy a flat screen.. but I am a young person without very much money. This was the best TV in this price range.<br /><br />The video is good and the TV looks sleek. The sound isn't very good though, so now I am saving up for a sound bar so I can actually hear my TV every time. The size is perfect for my tiny studio apartment.<br /><br />The remote is super small and flimsy and doesn't light up. I am not sure valuable remote space is wasted on a button dedicated to &#34;iHeart Radio&#34;... who uses that? If a radio type app gets a button then it should be Pandora or Spotify. Sometimes it doesn't connect to my wifi too well but I also have the cheapest wifi I could get so that could very well be my fault.<br /><br />All said, buy it if you can't afford any better, it will do you good!	4.0	August 1, 2015

I primarily use Netflix, and it has worked well.<br />A good buy for a solid price.	5.0	July 31, 2015

Give it 5 stars.&#34;<br />I liked the simple, easy to follow on-screen set up directions.  Simple to install.  The sound and picture quality are excellent.  This is our family's second smart tv; would not go back to using a Roku or even a Firestick as this is much simpler to use.  Everything you need to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime videos or satellite/cable tv is in the remote.  Simply push a button and you're good to go.	5.0	July 31, 2015

amazon.com	This TV is amazing. I bought this TV to fit into a new entertainment center that I purchased and it looks amazing! The first thing I have to commend is the shipping! They actually worked around my schedule, brought the box into the house, unpacked it, set it up and made sure everything worked before they left. I did not have to do much to the TV after setting up the cable top box, the picture is clean and crisp. I purchased a vizio soundbar for this TV and I definitely suggest doing the same as the sound on the TV was pretty bad, I have yet to play with the optimal settings, but it's cool to have the netflix and amazon button on the remote. I really wanted the 70', but it wouldn't fit, I was a little hesitant with Vizio, but they have exceeded my expectations!	5.0	July 31, 2015
amazon.com	I use this product as both a monitor for my PC, and a TV when I get in bed. It has worked great so far. My only complain is that sometimes the tv will become unresponsive to the remote - even with new batteries. This requires a manual shutdown.	4.0	July 31, 2015
amazon.com	I love everything about the TV except for one thing.  The legs are so short that the TV sits low on the table. It makes it hard to watch because I'm looking down.

I  Was talking with the representative from amazon and he recommended the Vizio TV! Great Choice. this one is a lot better than the sharp. great picture good sound for a small TV. set up was a breeze, about 10 minutes including wireless net. The only con that I have is the remote is a little small and there are only 2 HDMI inputs. Other than that it is a really nice TV for a 32inch.	4.0	July 28, 2015

amazon.com	I love the look of this TV with its small bezel and barely noticeable stand. The sound is fine to me. Adjusting the picture is very easy and there are tons of settings with a lot of choices. The internet hookup is a breeze and very intuitive.<br /><br />However, after many attempts, even with the advice from online TV bloggers, I just couldn't get a satisfactory picture. It would change too drastically between channels. I would finally be happy with the screen for a movie and then switch to CNN and have to start the adjustments all over.  Also the viewing angle is extremely poor. When I moved from the chair in front of the TV to the couch, some four feet away, the picture became faded with washed out colors. Even just standing instead of sitting in front of the TV made the colors look lighter.	2.0	May 1, 2015
amazon.com	Got the 24&#34; TV for kitchen. Mostly interested in the Netflix apps and DLNA for media. The TV functions just fine for what it is and Netflix is great. The only thing that don't work properly is DLNA. It does not play lots of formats like .mp4 as an example. The DLNA issue is a problem for all my friends with Vizio also and its a known for Vizio apparently. The movie files will work fine on the USB stick connected directly to TV, but just not through DLNA on Vizio. To me, I  don't care what the issue is or what the workaround is ... but if it supports DLNA , it needs to just work. It works fine on all my Samsung TV. Don't get Vizio if you use DLNA, you will be disappointed.	4.0	July 27, 2015

They hooked everything up and all I had to do was register the product by following the easy on screen step by step instructions and then connect it to the internet. Again, step by step instructions. All in all I couldn't be more pleased and I got an extra $50 of for being a Prime member too! Thanks Amazon..	5.0	July 26, 2015
amazon.com	for the money, vizio e-series tvs are the best bang for the buck. simple.  pull yourself back from the cliff, save your money, and simply buy the best bang for the buck.  you will  be happy you did.  (note:  unless you are a videophile or sitting close to the TV, UHD is a waste of money... at least for the next couple of years.  wait.)<br /><br />==========by the way=================================<br />why are so many reviews on this site and for this tv for other model numbers--- or worse--- years?????  the critical reviews for this model (e70, 2015) are almost all from prior year and smaller (completely different components and tech).  Plus, many of the reviews are from out of warranty issues.  how can anyone be out of warranty... unless they chose (foolishly) not to buy an extended warranty.  these are tvs... they break... extended warranties get you a repair or new one.<br /><br />anyway, PLEASE only write reviews for the actual item you are reviewing.  otherwise, those of us trying to discern which brand, model, and year are forced to sift through your unrelated non-sense.  nobody has that kind of time.<br /><br />thank you.	5.0	July 26, 2015

amazon.com	This TV is not actually 120 Hz as stated.  Vizio just used fancy wording to make consumers think it is.  My problem is, I have a stereo 3D system I wanted to use on this TV.  It takes 120 Hz for this to work.  Imagine my surprise when it didn't work.  After going through all the specs, I finally found it was actually a 60 Hz TV.  I contacted Vizios customer service to see if there was a way to change it, and they gave me the run around calling it &#34;SPS refresh rate&#34; which basically means the LED backlighting is scanning at 120 but the TV is actually refreshing at 60.  I'm sure most people don't really care because they don't need a TV that is actually 120Hz, but I did, and was very disappointed.  Other than that, the TV looks ok so far.	2.0	July 25, 2015

I have another Vizio in my living room which has been great. I like how easy set up is on these tvs and the picture is good. The sound on this tv is actually better than l expected thanks to the front facing speaker. I have a sound bar set up for the one in my living room because sound was lacking on that. So this is a nice feature for this 24 inch as l have it mounted in my bedroom with no real space for a sound bar. The size is perfect for a bedroom, dorm room, or probably an RV. Well worth the price!	5.0	July 25, 2015
amazon.com	I am returning this TV next chance I get. Unsure as to if its a manufacturing defect or something they could fix with a firmware update but the WiFi is completely worthless. I have a 30-50mbps connection at any given time which is more than capable to stream things on several devices simultaneously. This thing just does not play nice with others.<br /><br />I'm sitting here writing this review with the TV no more than 15' from my router and the only 2 devices on wifi are my phone writing this review and the TV. The network tests fine, full 5 bars, but launch any app and it either gives up after 1 minute or if you do connect it fails trying to buffer the media and crashes. The only way to get it back connected is to turn the TV off and back on.<br /><br />Other than that it is a very decent TV for the money. If you plan on using a computer or other streaming device I'm sure you will be more than thrilled with the picture quality, size weight and ports on the TV.	2.0	May 1, 2015

Delivery service included bringing the box inside unpacking it, plugging it in, and verifying that everything was in good order. Delivery guys were very helpful,  prompt, and courteous. Be aware that when you order a larger size TV you may also need a new router or additional hardware. Also,  arrange for cable service appointment. This is my second Vizio television very happy with the quality picture. Some folks do prefer adding a sound bar or other  speakers, which I agree could be helpful. However, the picture and smart apps are wonderful and I couldn't be happier. By the way, if you are wondering whether you  would feel overwhelmed by a 65 inch television screen let me assure you that it takes about five minutes to get used to it!

For starters my Panasonic Viera does not have a built in wireless adapter so I either have to run a cable or buy an external adapter to use the smart menu.  The only thing I can get to function on my Panasonic smart menu is Netflix but the menu for Vizio is by far better and everything functions.  The remote for this is small but no big deal, it has everything you need to operate the tv and it has a few buttons that will take you directly to the smart tv app you want.  Those buttons are Amazon, Netflix, and IHeart Radio.  Very easy to set up and there's even enough space to fit a DVD player under the TV once the legs are attached.	2.0	May 1, 2015

On normal or warm setting it looks like their is a filter on it. Computer is more accurate, and cool is cool. But overall no matter what I adjust even using software the color is always slightly off. So if you want to buy a tv that is great right out of the box without having to spend hours  or a lot of money trying to get it calibrated and looking good buy something else.	3.0	July 22, 2015

amazon.com	I own two 50 inch Vizio Tvs. My first purchase was the 4k TV. I purchased this led TV for my upstairs and thought I'd save a little. Honestly there is a large difference. It's worth spending a little extra money and going for the 4k. However if you can't swing a 4k it's not a bad TV. You notice the pixels a bit and its not as bright as some LEDs. You can obviously adjust the brightness. However the pixels become more noticeable when you do.	3.0	July 22, 2015

amazon.com	When the TV went out in our bedroom, I looked for another 32&#34;LG TV, since we've had such good luck with them.  I saw this Smart TV at a great price, so I thought I'd try VIZIO.  The set up of the TV and remote was an absolute snap.  The picture is exceptional!  However, I still haven't been able to get the &#34;Smart&#34; (wifi) part of the TV to work.  I'm pretty tech savvy, and with a bit of perseverance and google, I can usually figure most things out.  I spent and hour and a half on the internet trying to figure out why this wouldn't connect.  I did all the online tutorials and even went to You Tube.  I called customer service.  No wait and got a really great representative, Carolyn.  She worked with me for over an hour and still no connection.  I'm going to try one more suggestion that was in these reviews and if that doesn't do it, I'm returning it for a &#34;Non&#34; smart TV.  It looks like I'm not the only one who had a VIZIO who wouldn't connect to the Wifi and for the hassle, I don't need the access on this TV.	3.0	July 22, 2015

amazon.com	It's everything we hoped it would be.  The picture is bright and sharp, and the video settings are good, right out of the box.  Setup took a matter of minutes.<br /><br />This TV replaces an old DLP rear-projection set.  Because it had no HDMI input, we had to drive it using component cables, so it was running in 480p.  Also, the picture was so dim, we had to turn off all the lights in the room to watch it.  Relplacement bulbs cost $300, and needed to be replaced every six months.<br /><br />So it won't surprise you to hear that we are completely blown away by the difference.  No more dim room lights!  This one is quute literally dazzling.<br /><br />The built-in WiFi ain't too shabby either.  We've set aside enough Netflix movies to last us into 2016! ;-)	2.0	May 1, 2015

amazon.com	I've had this television for about a week now, and all in all, it's definitely a worthwhile purchase. But with all its pros come some cons. So let's break this package down, and take a look at why you should buy this TV if you're in the market for a thirty-two-inch, and why you should be prepared to not completely love it.<br /><br />First, the pros--<br /><br />1. This television's wireless. No Roku, no Chromecast, no Fire TV needed. You just open up the settings, find your network, plug in your password, and...voila. You're ready to be disappointed by the latest season of Orange is the New Black.<br /><br />2. This television has a native refresh rate of one-hundred-twenty hertz, with a simulated refresh of--I think--two-forty.That's not something you see in a lot of thirty-two inch budget sets. Most sit at around sixty hertz, which is fine if you'd like to pretend you're living in 1847, but this modern America, dagnabit. I want my one-hundred-twenty hertz of smooth motion goodness, and I'm not settling for anything less. And speaking of picture quality...<br /><br />3. It's 1080p. Says it right in the title, but I thought I'd remind you in case you'd forgotten already.<br /><br />4. It's cheap! And I don't mean cheap in terms of build-quality. That's actually pretty good, which I'll elaborate on in my next point. No, when I say cheap, I mean most sets with these specs at this size would be going for AT LEAST a hundred dollars more. And even most of the ones sitting at THAT price range will be trading off for either 720p or sixty hertz to keep the price down. What Vizio's offering here is an amazing deal, and Amazon's sweetened the pot with an extra ten dollars off for Prime members. Even Costco isn't selling them that cheap. Then again, you can't pick up a hot dog and a drink for a dollar-fifty while you're on Amazon. Or at least, you shouldn't.<br /><br />5. The build quality--it's actually pretty good.<br /><br />6. The smart menu's easy to access, unobtrusive, and looks about as good as a smart menu can look.<br /><br />Okay, now, on to the cons--<br /><br />1. The smart menu feels a little cluttered. It's got a lot of apps most people won't need, and despite an admittedly short time playing with it, I have yet to figure out how to remove the ones I don't use.<br /><br />2. For having such great specs, the picture quality on this TV doesn't blow me away the same way my fifty does or my old forty. I'm not sure why that is--maybe it's a setting I've missed--but that realism just isn't there to the same degree.<br /><br />3. It's thick. Not huge, mind you, but thicker than some of its counterparts. Did this bother me? No. But for some, I know, thickness is a big factor, either for practical reasons or bragging rights. Because, you know...that's a thing, I guess.<br /><br />4. There's no digital audio out. There's optical, sure, because that's the future. And there's RCA, because...that's the past? But my RS-160s are located in the present, and they operate on digital. Now, this obviously isn't a HUGE deal, since you can spend thirteen dollars to convert your optical to digital, or spent four and change on some RCA adapters, but if you use headphones or a sound system reliant on a digital audio out port, be sure you order some kind of adapter to get it working with this set right out of the box. Because apparently, RCA's still a big deal, but your headphones are a thing of the past.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an amazing deal for a great TV, and despite some very minor flaws, I'd recommend this to anyone looking to spruce up their dorm room, bedroom, office, or studio with a sleek budget television.	4.0	July 21, 2015

amazon.com	First off, ignore the people complaining about the TV they had shipped received as damage. That's a problem with the shipping service, not Vizio. Giving a TV a 1 star rating for a UPS screw up is absolutely stupid. Also, don't let those complaining of a buzz coming from the back ruin your chance at a great product. Some claim they can't even hear the voices of people on TV it's so loud - they're full of it. I have a subwoofer with an amp that makes a way louder buzzing sound that is completely inaudible with just a PC fan running. This TV has a tiny hum, not a BUZZ. You have to stick your head behind the TV with nothing else on to even hear it. It's just electricity and in no way signifies damage. Angry nerds will be angry nerds.<br /><br />There is one issue I have. The ethernet port is on the underside of a part that juts out. It was fine until I bought a new ethernet cable that had a longer doo-hicky on it (for pressing on and releasing it from the port). I now have an ethernet cable forever stuck in my television.<br /><br />Check rtings.com for a general idea of what you'd be getting with the E-series. Read the review, the Q&A, and use the compare tool to see what the competition (Samsung) is like. Also read up on the calibration of colors for these sets. Do keep in mind they say each set of a different size will need to be calibrated differently, but you'll know how complicated of a task you're in for just by checking theirs for the 55&#34; and 60&#34;. Using the color tuner as they did would be a daunting task, requiring a $100+ tool or $100+ service by a professional. For the 40&#34; color tuner I followed a CNET review's calibrations, but I also turned the color up to 60. The optimal amounts of contrast, brightness, and backlight are going to be different for practically everything. Different shows look better with different settings, even games that switch between day and night. It will drive you crazy finding the perfect presets, but you can save up to 6 of them and change individual ones in the little ways needed. I have a separate one for regular PC viewing, PC gaming, Wii U gaming, TV watching, and Netflix. After enough practice I know exactly what to change, but believe me I screwed with the settings for over 24 hours in total before being comfortable with each source. You wouldn't notice on a TV with hardly any settings to change, so really I'm quite satisfied with being able to bring the optimal picture, even to shows that may have filmed with a strangely warm filter added on top. You can set it and forget it if you aren't that technical about it.<br /><br />Different sizes of the E-series have different amounts of lag input, and I know at least 40&#34; and above has game mode to reduce the latency. It doesn't have much of an affect on the picture, other than its intended job in aiding gamers. I suspect the different sized models may have different amounts of motion blur as well. With 60fps sources I don't really notice it. That's the problem with this TV though - most film is 24fps. Watching nature films in 1080p looks great - until they, while close, pan the camera around a mountain. With or without trees, these scenes give the most noticeable amount of motion blur. You can't enjoy the detail of 1080p because of the amount of blur. Turning on Clear Action alleviates the problem, somewhat. While it does decrease motion blur, it also turns the backlight way down and you will notice a flicker. Not just 'sensitive' users as they claim. It's so obvious. I do not use it for anything, but I don't take points off for it being available. Just know there are better sets for watching movies and documentaries. It is still awesome for gaming, however.<br /><br />The panels are VA in the 40, but some larger models will be switching to IPS in the future (or already have?). For gaming you'd want a VA. IPS for movies and television. You can find out which a Vizio has by checking the model number. Just google it.<br /><br />480p upscaling handled by the display is pretty awful when the source is a console like the original Wii. Watching shows off Netflix seems to look better using the Smart App built in rather than using a PC and going to their site, if you're going to be viewing in 384p or 480p. For the shows I watch in that resolution on Netflix, with the noise cancelling options turned to high, even 384p looks great. 720p is pretty good for video games that are natively so; definitely better than my old 720p native television from 2009. 1080p is absolutely wonderful on this set.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Great picture. Not a lot of motion blur, but for gaming you may want to turn on game mode and/or research the pros and cons of 120Hz in current televisions. Great price. The remote received undue complaints concerning its build. Not including a qwerty though, whether that bothers you is preference. I can just put a USB dongle into the TV and use a wireless keyboard, and the only thing I really used it for was for putting in my Netflix login info. Having to make sure you have each input's calibrations right can be a pain, and would be pretty annoying for someone that just can't decide on which settings look best. I obsessed over my presets for longer than most anyone would care to, or that would even consider the difference to be worth the time consumed.The 40&#34; i received has WAY better gray scale uniformity than what rtings.com reviewed it. Same for the black. They did not include the 40&#34; in their review however, so that may be why. For instance with an all black picture they say you can see the LEDs behind the screen. Absolutely not so with the 40&#34;. All you see is the perfect black.<br /><br />I am so glad I did not waste my money on a brand name.	5.0	July 20, 2015
amazon.com	I researched TVs for a month before buying the 50&#34; Vizio E series. Like many, I am excited about the prospects of 4k and OLED.  However, both of these technologies are expensive right now, and impossible to find together.  I set my budget at $1000, yet I ended up with a $500 TV.  My research indicated that a really good 4k TV is more than my budget would allow, and a noticeably and measurably better 1080p set almost doesn't exist.  For twice the money, I didn't think the small improvements over the Vizio E-series would be worth it.<br /><br />I've had this TV for over a month now, and its been great.  On center, the black level is impressive; much better than the IPS panel it is replacing.  Viewing angles are fine; I notice a quality dropoff from dead-center, but I always sit in the same place, and most people aren't so picky.  My backlight is uniform. There are some brighter patches, but they don't bother me for the price I paid.  The corners are slightly darker, but you won't notice if you watch letterbox movies, and dramas usually have darker corners anyway.  Startup time is fast enough and the menus are snappy an logical.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  This TV will be fine until a 4k OLED TVs are within reach.	5.0	July 20, 2015

amazon.com	TV looked nice, but did not meet expectations. Choose this TV over the TCL - Roku TV because I knew the Vizio name and it got pretty good reviews, however, was hesitant because read some negative reviews. Know different people have various interpretations of what they consider &#34;problems&#34;, so opted to give it a try, but  when steaming HD movies/shows, picture would go fuzzy sometimes. Had it conected via HDMI cable, so not sure what the problem was. Ended up returning this TV and decided to go in a different direction (went with my original pic - TCL). Was also disappointed in apps selection. Vizio's advertising is very inaccurate on how many apps this TV has and/or can even get. (in my opinion, Yahoo is not the best partner to have in the world of smart TV apps.) Very limited, especially compared to Roku. The only reason for 2 stars is the helpfulness of Amazon customer service to get this returned.	2.0	July 20, 2015

But there is no option to skip, decline, go back, etc.  I miss my show because of constant &#34;searching for updates&#34; and pop ups for iheart radio.  This is getting returned this week.  Avoid this.  It's not worth the hassle	1.0	July 19, 2015

amazon.com	I researched and I purchased this TV for our 261BHXL Forest River Camper. There were 4 factors that I was looking for: Smart Tv, LED, Weight & USB input. I found that this tv weighed in only at 11lbs and that was the best that I could find that I thought that I would have been comfortable with leaving it mounted on the wall inside a camper while pulling. The led lighting was newest technology and I bought this due to it helping on weight and depth size of the tv. The Smart portion of the tv we would use at certain campgrounds that offered Wi-Fi and when it rains that would help out with the kids. The final thing was the usb input, For all the movies we can fit on a thumb drive this was something for when there was no wifi or hd antenna would pick up.	5.0	July 19, 2015

amazon.com	I wanted to put this in my toy hauler and access the internet in campgrounds  using MY APPS without my laptop hooked to it with a firewire cable. So I bought this smart tv WRONG choice. Below is why.<br /><br />You can only use what apps that VIzio decided that you need to use. Its preloaded with apps and that's all you can get till Vizor decides to up date them. Unlike the Samsung Smart Tv you can NOT add any of your own apps to this tv or even get on the internet and browse. So in my opinion how can you call this a smart tv?<br /><br />Should of spent the 30 extra dollars and got a real smart tv (Samsung). We own a samsung smart tv in the family room. Comparing the two is like comparing night and day. This is a you get what Vizio thinks you need tv.<br /><br />Yes, you can stream Internet content but it's only what Vizio thinks you should stream. Yes, you can access the Internet but only to what Vizio thinks you should access. BIG PLAY ON WORDS in their ads.	1.0	July 19, 2015

amazon.com	This set is a mixed bag.In terms of being an HDTV it has very good picture quality when viewing over the air broadcast HD signals, the mixed bag comes when you delve into the &#34;Smart TV&#34; aspects of this unit, which are after all the reason you might buy it.<br /><br />The app's are wildly inconsistent, Netflix great, Youtube great, Amazon poor, the App produces 704x400 resolution with Amazon video, not very good, lot's of jaggy pixelated images.<br /><br />When I use the Netgear Push2TV device with my Kindle it works fine but that sort of defeats the purpose of buying a &#34;Smart TV&#34;.<br /><br />This is my first and only &#34;Smart TV&#34; so I cannot make a definitive recommendation but I can say that if you want to use this with the Amazon<br />Prime App you would be be better served buying a &#34;Dumb TV&#34; and a Netgear Push2TV unit.<br /><br />As I continue with my cord cutting experiments I will look at other models but this one I really can't recommend based on the Amazon App being so poorly implemented.	3.0	July 18, 2015

Issues: 1) It does bloom in and out as I'm watching, haven't found a way to fix that. 2) Picture is not the best. Have a difficult time finding a setting that resembles any of the other TV's in the house. 3) If you're not watching it straight on, the picture degrades the more to the side you are. Didn't expect that ! 4) Remote is not difficult to use as others have said. 5) My other TV's show different (more) apps than this one does. That's surprising.<br />I'll debate it for a few more days but may end up returning it for an exchange. Hopefully this could just be a lemon...<br /><br />Update: 1st TV had blooming and fading issues when viewed from the side as others have mentioned. Called to return/exchange TV and the entire process was handled quite well by David K. He got my info and processed the claim with no issues. Was informative and helpful in getting it settled to my satisfaction. New TV received and as of yet does not have the same issues...	3.0	July 16, 2015

There is nothing on the outside of the tv.  Bought the TV back in November.  After several calls back and forth with customer service today, I was told at 6:00 pm they were sending us a new TV.  Got a call back at 8:30 pm saying that it wasn't covered so we were out of luck.  They won't back down even though they had already said they were sending a replacement.  We have had several issues with this TV before this but this beats it all.  The remote is terrible.  It doesn't work half the time and you have to take the batteries out and reset it to get it to work.  This summer, the TV itself started freezing up. We would have to unplug the tv and discharge all the power to get it to work. The screen breaks on its own during the warranty time and we are out of luck even though they initially said they were replacing it. Terrible product and service.  Will never buy another Vizio again.  Stay far away.	1.0	July 15, 2015
amazon.com	I know that there are 381 reviews you can go through.  I realize that is a lot.  I want to share, however, that I am so pleased with this Vizio TV.  I ordered it through Prime and once again it arrived in 2 days in perfect condition.  This television is 50 inches.  My family and friends gave me grief, telling me it's going to be way to big.  But it's not!  It's perfect!  The quality of the picture is really beautiful.  I was nervous at first with my satellite reception in HD was not going to be that nice, but it far surpassed my expectations.  The 1080i is extremely clear and when I have my Apple TV turned on for Netflix it is also in 1080i and just as vivid and clear.  I cannot say enough about this television and do recommend to all who are contemplating buying one.	5.0	July 15, 2015
amazon.com	Very Capable Smart TV and a good size for my need.  The TV installed without any issues in less then 15 minutes.  The connection to the internet, Amazon Prime and Netflix was a snap as well.  The TV is also built on a low stand which as exactly what I needed as it had to fit into a confined space, this allowed me to buy a 32&#34; versus something smaller, which is good.  The remote is also good, as there is one button access for both Amazon Prime and Netflix.  Finely, the picture quality is excellent and sound isn't too bad for such a small TV, works well in the bedroom where it's located.  I would recommend this TV to a friend.	5.0	July 15, 2015

amazon.com	Lack of native 5GHz wireless support dampens an otherwise well engineered product. The picture quality responds well to adjustment and can be configured to suit personal preferences. For example, by transferring the calibration values from a Top Tier 40&#34; Samsung used for gaming which was calibrated using the HDTV feature included with XBOX ONE, the Vizio E50-C1 largely assumed the same visual impression albeit not at the same level of refinement, losing some of the picture clarity and detail that makes the Samsung (3D Model) picture seem almost surreal because of its sharpness, color range, and contrast dynamics even when viewing streaming content. It makes up for this with 5 zone dynamics optimization which delivers absolute blacks and is actually better than the Samsung in this regard. The menu system and auto configuration features are also better.<br /><br />For the price and considering the screen size, this model is a home run for consumers seeking value in the larger 50&#34; form factor whom choose to stick with the HDTV standard instead of transitioning to the newer 4K Ultra standard (with Ultra pricing) that require more bandwidth to feed such as Cat 7 network cabling or disk based playback to realize the improvements in resolution.  Adding an Amazon Fire TV which fully supports 5GHz AC wireless transmitting standards, makes the 2.4 GHz native feature of this set a minor issue. Even the Amazon Fire Stick works well and appears in the input menu by name. The Vizio remote can also automatically replace the Fire TV remote although certain nags will briefly appear as the Fire TV tries to locate its paired remote partner.<br /><br />Overall this is a great value.	4.0	July 14, 2015
amazon.com	To go along with the sound bar you have to have a big TV! We have 2 VIZIO TVs in our house and have never had any issues with them. We were lucky enough to get this type of TV even cheaper from target because the owner’s manual was missing. There is actually one on the TV if you have a problem looking for something. The smart TV feature is cool about this TV. The TV includes apps such as YouTube, Netflix, iHeart Radio, etc. This is a convenient feature to have on the TV. We mounted this TV to the wall and it was easy to do so. Luckily it hasn’t fallen! I recommend this product!	5.0	July 14, 2015

amazon.com	I have been having serious issues with this model since it was installed on my wall.  Let me first state, I've been a Vizio fan and buyer since 2007.  Back then, I purchased a 32&#34; 720p and a 37&#34; 720p.....both worked fine right out of the box and never an issue.  In fact, they're both working just fine today.  About a week prior to purchasing this set, I purchased an E-43 through another seller......have had issues with that one also......one HDMI doesn't work.......the rest of the bugs I've managed to work out.  Currently, I'm working with Vizio to see if the issues on the E-50 can be worked out.  Some I have managed to correct myself.  I think I finally have the color dialed in.  The first issue was getting the wi-fi to sync up.  It took a few days and I'm good to go in that department.  I am doing everything I can to resolve these issues prior to the 30 day return period expire.  I hate to return anything to Amazon as they've treated me like family.  During the past 8<br />months, I've had horrible luck when purchasing anything electronic or electrical on line.  If I have to return, the question that comes to mind is......do I ask for a replacement of the same model or should I step up to the Vizio 4K model?  As stated earlier, I am a big fan of Vizio and Amazon.  I do hope to come back soon and update my review with a higher rating. UPDATE:  7/25/2015.  I've increased my rating by one star due to issues being resolved.  There are sites online that give recommendations of how and what to adjust the color to.  I did as instructed and my color is great.  I recommend the Vizio Sound Bar for a much better sound.  The difference is astounding and worth the investment.  With the two Vizios I purchased in 2007, I didn't place and extended warranty on either of them and they're both still working just fine.  Based on a ton of reviews I've read on the Internet, I found buyers were having issues between 1 1/2 to to years which is outside of Vizios warranty period.  With that in mind, I placed an extended warranty to cover the first four years.  Square Trade was my choice and found, if you shop online, you can find a better price.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  that you purchase a surge protector (these are a cheap add on) as I have done this with all my electronic equipment.  Please be aware surge protectors have a limited useful life and have to be replaced periodically (5 years?).  I hate to have to return anything to Amazon.  Today is the end of my 30 day grace period and I'm happy to say THIS IS A KEEPER.  Granted, it took some time on my part to work out the issues but well worth my time for the end result.	3.0	July 12, 2015

amazon.com	We got this TV to replace a 40&#34; samsung that was damaged in a lightening storm.  Set up was easy...the remote is intuitive and the picture is wonderful.  We had a sound bar with our 40&#34; and have removed it for this TV, as the sound is much better with it.<br /><br />We are very happy.  The smart TV option means we have less &#34;stuff&#34; to attach to the TV.  Much cleaner/easier.<br /><br />Definitely recommend for a good...slightly upgraded..main TV	4.0	July 12, 2015

amazon.com	First, let me say i've only had this TV for about an hour so I haven't had a chance to dive really deep into the settings or anything. But my first impressions about this is Great! Its picture right out of the box is spectacular. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. the only thing missing is a POWER BUTTON! I know it sounds silly, but its true! The only way to turn this set off and on is with the remote! I'll eventually get around to programing the Comcast remote so it might not be that big of a deal soon. Other than that, its really a good TV. The setup is really easy. It even renames the HDMI1 input to &#34;Cable Box&#34; for you. Very happy with the purchase.	4.0	July 11, 2015

amazon.com	After hitting a previous M-32 model VIZIO bedroom sized TV with the vacuum cleaner and  breaking the screen. I ordered the newer E-32 as a replacement.. The picture is great running off an older roof antenna boosted by a 21 Db. Amp that captures 16 channels in HD in my fringe area. The backlit Led.'s give an even sharp picture with my own calibrated settings. The newer E series in 32&#34; lacks the zone feature of the previous M series, but I have not noticed any difference in quality of the black tones, nor have I had any pixilation problems on fast moving sports. The 120 refresh rate seems to work as advertised and the fast motion 240 settings must be working also.. This VIZIO is every bit as good as the more expensive Samsung I use in the family area.. I would recommend this set for use in any low light 225 Sq. Ft. room, it's size is perfect without overwhelming the viewer.. and the remote is simple to operate by feel alone.	4.0	July 10, 2015

amazon.com	I've never owned a ViZiO Tv before, I was always a Samsung kind of guy, but this TV is actually amazing not the best but pretty damn close.<br /><br /> I got this TV mainly for my 6year old niece, which mainly watches TV at the moment, but good too for the future if ever wants to play games.<br /><br />The T.V came in the TV box which shows that it is in fact a tv that's one thing I didn't like I'd of liked it if maybe it was wrapped with more protection & or at least wrapped so you don't know what it was. The TV is in flawless condition; no dead pixels,no damage, & no scratches!<br /><br />Now that we got that out of the way, I'd like to talk about the TV itself:<br /><br />I googled a lot of information before choosing this brand of TV & they said out of all of the 40&#34; TV brands of a 1080p TV, ViZio was the best.<br /> I can't really say if ViZio is the best tv to get if looking for a 40&#34; tv but I can tell you it isn't a bad choice. I'm coming from a Samsung ES8000 46&#34; and the only flaw that I don't like out of this TV is the clear action option which makes the screen darker, the black detail which makes the picture look like crap, & the active led zones which does about the same as the clear action which all of these settings can be turned off if not like which is a good thing. I played a few PS4 games on it and wasn't unhappy at all it runs fast and looks great with no complaints from me and I'm a serious gamer lol. Just like every other TV the Sun is a huge distraction. So, try keeping the Sun away from the tv or you won't be happy watching tv.<br /><br />Every TV I get I search for the best settings & then play around with it until I'm happy with the settings. For this TV, I went here:<br />1.http://www.rtings.com/reviews/tv/lcd-led/vizio/e-series-2015<br />& 2. http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/vizio-e-series-2015-picture-settings-642363/<br /><br />Then like I said I play with the settings. I like everything they suggested just I added more to the Backlight, Brightness, and color.<br /><br />My settings are:<br />Picture Mode &#60;Calibrated Dark&#62;<br />Backlight=100<br />Brightness=62<br />Contrast=80<br />Color=60<br />Tint=0<br />Sharpness=10<br />----------------------------<br />More Picture&#62;&#62;:<br />Color Temperature=COOL<br />Black Detail=OFF<br />Active LED Zones=OFF<br />Clear Action=OFF<br />Reduce Noise=LOW for both<br />Game Low Latency=OFF<br />Film Mode=Auto<br />Gama=2.2<br />-----------------------------------------<br />Color Calibration&#62;&#62;:<br />Red Gain= -2<br />Green Gain= 1<br />Blue Brightness=16\||\Offset=1<br />----------------------------<br />11 Point White Balance&#62;&#62;:<br />10%: 8, 5, 7<br />20%: -14, -14, -13<br />30%: -35, -33, -33<br />40%: -30, -30, -30<br />50%: -30, -28, -32<br />60%: 0, 0, -5<br />70%: 0, 0, -5<br />80%: 0, 0, 0<br />90%: 0, 0, 0<br />100%: 0, 0, 0<br />____________________________<br />The TV comes with 3 hdmi which I wish had 4 just because. Other things:<br />USB,HDMI, & Audio out are on the side but opposite from the power cord.<br />Behind the TV are 2 HDMIs, Ethernet, Component, & DTV.<br />AS you know this is a smart TV and it has its own store to download more apps if would like to.<br />TV remote is great it has a amazon video prime & netflix button just not sure why they didn't add a hulu one but instead they put a iheartradio which  pandora is better imo....<br />The remote also has a smart home button which pulls up your apps..<br />Some shows that have blackbars which I seriously hate, this TV has an option to stretch the screen which is lovely but only works on some not all depending on how the blackbars are positioned.<br /><br />I hope this was a helpful review not really sure of anything to add that could help anymore... So now it's up to you to decide if you want to buy it or not.	4.0	July 10, 2015

Personally I've never had a minute's problem with any other TVs soundbars subwoofers all been great.  The price was amazing couldn't even come close to it locally.  Well packaged, no issues with shipping, I  tracked it all the way to my home. Real time updates.  I definitely will recommend it to friends.	5.0	July 9, 2015

A couple of the presets for picture are not to my liking, but it is great to be able to set my own settings as part of the options.  This TV is much better picture and ease of use than the previous 52&#34;, like the smaller screen.	4.0	July 9, 2015
amazon.com	Description didn't say how many HDMI ports it had,so I went through reviews where they were saying 3 and some occasionaly saying 4,didn't really buy that but my last vizio had 3(the minimum I need) so I went for it.Only to be very disappointed to only have 2 hdmi ports.Who still does that with all the stuff that we need to connect to our tvs.Doubt I will ever buy a vizio again now which is sad because I really loved my last one,still going strong and now in the guest bedroom.These things should be clearly marked in the specs of all your tvs.I could have gotten 1 with the 3 HDMIs for the same price or maybe a little less.To sum it up,certainly a great tv just not what i needed and thought I was getting,and as much as I love Amazon I may just have to go Brick and Mortar for my electronics since then I know what I'm getting.	3.0	July 9, 2015
amazon.com	Purchased for my bedroom, once again Vizio delivers. Great price for what you get. Picture looked great too. Sound is good but you have to have the volume over 50 before you can hear anything decently.

amazon.com	I evidently did a bit better than average, since my tv lasted almost two years instead of the more usual 18 months before breaking down.  One day in the middle of watching tv, suddenly neither the remote nor the manual buttons on the TV work.  The tv can't be turned on or off, can't call up menus, no streaming, can't change the channel, nothing.  After a lot of runaround, Vizio customer service &#34;can't do anything&#34; because I'm out of warranty.  Yes, it's been almost 2 years but really, a total breakdown of all functionality of my &#34;smart&#34; tv is an utter product-quality fail.  I will never buy Vizio anything ever again.	1.0	July 6, 2015

It is not always there but pops up occasionally. I think the picture is good quality but I am not the expert.

There aren't a lot of video or audio settings but the standard picture settings are easy to understand and access. There seems to be a good variety of smart TV apps, which are just a button away. The wireless connection wasn't too difficult to set up and signal strength from a room away is pretty strong.<br /><br />Cons: The screen is a bit reflective, especially in low light settings. The is no VGA input. The remote control does not have a QWERTY keyboard, so typing can be a lit slow when accessing the smart functions.	5.0	July 4, 2015

amazon.com	I got the 40 inch one as a gift and while it does have an incredible value, I would not recommend this to people who want an excellent HD viewing experience. It may be true that this set can deliver 1080p picture quality, but it cannot do so constantly at high frame rates without randomly displaying a &#34;choppiness&#34; or &#34;clippiness&#34; in whatever you are watching (game, movie, show, etc). This one fatal flaw breathes despair and shame over this otherwise excellent set. I will be returning mine. I can't recommend this tv unless you want your viewing experience to be filled with frustration and sadness.	2.0	July 2, 2015

amazon.com	Arrived very well packaged and on time. We bought the 50 inch. It is perfect for our bedroom! We easily mounted it to the wall(mount not included). I love how light weight this TV is(28 lbs.). The controller is cheap feeling but is working great so far and fits nice in your hand with great button placement! The TV itself feels a little cheap but what do you expect for the price. We have a very expensive Samsung TV in our living room and seriously this TV is just as great!- so low price doesn't always mean worse. We don't use the apps or anything else like that so cannot comment on those. The picture is great and very clear. The sound is not too bad but wasn't to my liking, so my husband bought the Vizio 29 inch sound bar and that pairs very well with this TV! Save yourself some money and buy this TV- and maybe even the sound bar!:)	5.0	July 1, 2015
