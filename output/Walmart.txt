walmart.com	I bought this TV b/cuz I was tired of my old one. I was a lil skeptic b/cuz of the brand name. I did some research &amp; found out SCEPTRE brand has been around since 1984. I checked out how they have advance in making computer Monitors to TV&#39;s ... LCD...LED..HD &amp; 3D TV&#39;s. After reading the walmart.com reviews I couldn&#39;t pass up the price. Shipping 2the store was free, fast &amp; easy. Installation was a breeze even with hooking up my X-1 platform xfinity cable box, DVD player &amp; the picture was so pretty I decided to connected my computer with a Belkin F3X1982-10 VGA/UXGA Monitor Cable to the TV (I eventually put it on my wall) b/cuz the picture was so B.E.A.utiful. If you are thinking about buying a different brand name TV just b/cuz of the name... please don&#39;t!!!!! Save your $$$ you will be impressed with this one. GREAT BUY!!!!!!	Menu	11/3/2013
walmart.com	The screen came with a smudge in the lower corner. I contacted sceptre and sent pictures of it. They replied that it was caused by physical damage and was not covered by the warranty. I asked how they could tell by pictures. They replied they can tell by the lines. I could not see any lines. I also told them the set itself and packing material was not damaged. A few days later I told them the smudge was getting bigger and darker. They replied that the LED&#39;s were burning out and to take it up with the shipping co. Fedex. After that they stopped replying to my E-Mails. Very dissatisfied with customer service and will never purchase anything that is made by them.	Toggle Search	6/22/2011
walmart.com	This is my second purchase of a Sceptre, First one was a 51 about 2 years ago. Very impressed and decided to get this one for our bedroom. I would highly recommend this brand, and I think I got a great deal on both from Walmart.com.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	6/14/2014
walmart.com	For the price this is an exceptional value. Picture and setup are very good. Warranty and shipping excellent. Overall features and set up excellent.

walmart.com	We bought this for our twin boys bedroom Christmas Dec 2012. Well guess what - now 13 months later it has died. That figures as it is just past the 12 month Manufacture warranty too and I did not buy the extended warranty. It was used only 1 hour or less a day - if that. The signs of something going wrong before it totally messed up was when you tried to power it on, the blue LED on front showed it on but only remained as black screen. We could not power it off on the TV button nor the remote so we had to unplug it from the wall. That seemed to work for a few days and how we would be able to somehow get it powered back on. But today, after over 12 attempts of trying to power it on we finally some how we got it powered back on. This time I kept it POWERED on while putting it on the ROKU2 XS source hooked up to this TV since the ROKU has a screen saver. For now we are leaving it POWERED ON while waiting for a different TV we just bought from Walmart but this time we bought a different brand AND with the 4 year extended warranty. This Sceptre TV was awesome.. truly it was...but it died so quickly even though this TV was hardly ever used. If you dare to buy this, be sure to buy the EXTENDED WARRANTY.

walmart.com	I bought this to replace a failed 32&#34; Aquos, and while the picture may not be quite as good, it&#39;s not bad at all -- nothing I could find particular fault with, especially considering it&#39;s half the price I paid for the Sharp three years ago. The Sceptre name isn&#39;t that well-known yet, but they&#39;ve been making high-quality LCD computer monitors since 1993, so it&#39;s only natural that they would branch out into HDTV. This is a basic set, and you can tell that corners have been cut in a few places to meet the price point: for example, the remote control has a slightly cheap, plastic-y feel to it, and as others have commented, the audio is a bit flat; however, the latter can be successfully compensated for by adjusting the set&#39;s EQ settings. There is also plenty of control in the menu system for tweaking the video, aspect, and and other settings to your liking. Three HDMI inputs are a plus, and I like the headphone jack so I can watch it late at night without disturbing anyone. Can you get a nicer, fancier 32&#34; panel for an extra $80 to $100? Of course, and those so inclined might check out LG or Sony. But if you&#39;re looking for bang-for-the-buck value, this Sceptre is a great choice.	Search	2/11/2014
walmart.com	3 years ago I bought a similar tv, same size and specs for OVER $600. It was damaged in a move. So i needed a new one, I recently learned that ALL LCD TVS are manufactured by only 3 companies in China who then sells them to name brand companies who creat their own cases and resell them for MUCH more. This Septra TV has beautiful picture quality and sells for $249 online I am very pleased with my purchase.	Items in cart	6/1/2011

walmart.com	Up front I will tell you I&#39;m no expert on HD tvs. However, after purchasing this one I have become a fan of the Sceptre. I rated sound just below excellent as I have yet to hear a flat screen with good sound and this one does a decent job of sound. Picture and sound are both quite configurable and with the remote you can change between settings lightining fast depending on your preference and channel. As many have said on reviews of many tvs, it takes some tweaking to get it to your likeing but right out of the box it was very good. In fact, the more I changed the more I found myself going to built in settings for sound and picture. I don&#39;t have HD programming with my dish service but the dish receiver has a setting for widescreen which makes all the difference HD or no. I did purchase a DVD player and HDMI cable at the same time. With these, the picture is amazing and with all the different connections and settings I have found nothing I can&#39;t connect and be able to set to my liking and enjoyment. You won&#39;t be dissapointed with this purchase. I have noticed the specs are identicle to many so my guess is that they are made by the same manufacturer as some of the high end models. After setting this up my wife has been wondering why I don&#39;t watch tv with her... until she watched a movie with me on this one... now I&#39;m looking to buy another!

walmart.com	I bought this TV a week ago to use it as a monitor for my new computer. Also purchased this cable from Walmart to connect the HDMI port (1 Link Depot 2m Male Gold Plated DVI-D Dual Link to High Speed HDMI Cable) on the TV to the computer. I also have basic cable TV so I split the coax with a splitter ran one coax to the cable modem and the other to the coax connection on the TV. Now I can switch it from a computer monitor to watching TV with the remote control. Good Deal! It also has a VGA monitor connection in case you don&#39;t have a DVI port on your computer. So far I&#39;m very happy with it as a computer monitor and TV. It was very easy to set up and has a nice size remote control. The picture quality is good. You can&#39;t go wrong with this combination TV, Computer Monitor. Hope this helps!	5.0	4/22/2011

walmart.com	After having 2 Vizio Tvs die on me in just over 2 years. I decided to try this Tv . I use it in the bedroom. The picture quality is very good . I did find the sound quality was not that great , untill i adjusted it in the settings. I do love the remote that came with it. Its very easy to use. If you decide to have shipped to the store, it could take longer than 10 days and i did find that a big pain, i wish i had paid the extra for faster shipping. It was like watching a slow boat to china. It only had to be shiped from 2 states away.	5.0	3/16/2011
walmart.com	The price is the thing that attracted me to this TV. After reading the customer reviews I felt it was worth the gamble to buy it. With the money I was saving on price I went ahead and bought a 3 year warranty. I opted for the free delivery, was offered other options with nominal additional cost but wasn&#39;t in a hurry, to my surprise the TV arrived two days later. The unit was very easy to set up and had it on within 15 minutes of opening the box. This is my first time buying a large item online from Walmart and the experience has been very pleasant one.

Much lighter and bigger too. So far no problems, it&#39;s been about two weeks. I&#39;ll hope for a lot more years. It was shipped in half the quoted time, and on my day off so that was nice.	5.0	11/11/2013

walmart.com	I was looking at Wal-Mart.com the day before Thanksgiving to see what kind of deals were going on in the electronics. I saw this TV and the price especially. I have a dinosaur TV and thought it would be a nice time to make a change to an updated version. I ordered it online. It took a couple of weeks to come in because of the holiday sales, etc. When it came in and I took it home, I thought &#34;man this TV is light&#34;. The hardest thing about getting it hooked up was the stand that comes with it. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was because it did not come with the cable that I needed to hook up my HD satellite receiver. I had to go and purchase one to hook up the satellite. Once everything was connected, the quality of the picture was GREAT!! I told my husband, &#34;So this is what everyone has been talking about with HD quality TVs and receivers&#34;. I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase, especially since it was such a good price. Recommend to anyone who is looking for a new TV.	4.0	9/13/2013

walmart.com	the picture and sound quality in this LED tv are very acceptable. the LCD tv it replaced had slightly better color, but the greatly reduced power requirements more than make up for that in my off grid cabin. i have been able to rely solely on my solar panels to charge my house batteries even with these short and sometimes cloudy winter days, and since I installed this tv a month ago that means no more traipsing outside on cold winter nights to start and stop the generator, a very welcome difference!! one channel had some lines in it, so i contacted the online Sceptre tech support, and they told me it was in the signal. I doubted that, but contacted my satellite provider anyway as they recommended, and it turned out that the Sceptre techs were correct. They also helped me know how to connect it, since the input was different for my old tv. It is sure nice to know that they are available to help. this is just a great basic LED tv, nothing fancy. I believe it is as good as any other big name brand of its size and features, and for the price it can&#39;t be beat.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	8/15/2011
walmart.com	This is a terrible product and I regret buying it. I should have listened to the other warnings and poor reviews. You truly do get what you pay for. At the low price, I didn&#39;t expect it to be the greatest HDTV out there, but I did expect the thing to at least power up and turn on. I called the tech support number but it went to voicemail. What kind of company runs that way? Leave them a message and wait for a call back?! I don&#39;t think so!!

walmart.com	I am pleasantly surprised at how good the picture is on this under $200.00 TV. I understand that it is made using Sony parts and that is one of the criteria I used to choose it. I run it using a Sony TiVo DVR, which I got from Direct TV. I realize that the Direct TV and TiVo people do not exactly love one another!!! However, the Spectre code number 0313 does not work to program the remote, so knowing that the parts are Sony, I used a Sony code and it seems to work okay. But, every once in while when I am choosing programs to record in channel numbers 501 and above, it will slip out of HDMI1 into HDMI2 and I will lose the signal. Perhaps there is a better code than the one I am using. I do know how to get it back by using the TV remote Source button, so I do that. It is an inconvenience, however. All in all, a great TV for the money!	4.0	3/8/2011
walmart.com	When looking for a T.V. for my bedroom I came across this Spectre, which was a great bargain. I guess for what I paid I can&#39;t be that picky. The picture is O.K. although the colors are a little dull. The sound however is the absolute worst. It sounds muffled no matter what settings I put it on. At time the sound also goes in and out as if it&#39;s about to give all the way. I find myself keeping my fingers crossed hoping that It wont and that it will last at least for a couple of years, or give out now while I still have my warranty. If I had a chance to do it all over again, I think I would just spring for the extra hundred dollars or so and get a recognized name brand.	4.0	3/18/2011

walmart.com	Let me put it this way, this is a great television for the price you are paying. The only downside is that it&#39;s 720p. My rule of thumb is anything 32 inches or more should be 1080p. 1080p referes to how many pixels it has; 1920(left to right) x 1080 (up and down). It&#39;s a very simple concept, the wider you stretch 720 pixels, the less detail you will get, but Sceptre has still managed to get good quality out of it. If it was up to me I would make this 1080p and sell it for $5 more. Anyways, buy this TV because you won&#39;t be disapointed, considering what you paid for it.	5.0	11/22/2013

walmart.com	I am just now ditching my old 200 lb CRT tv for these new, thinner (lightweight) models. The picture on this tv is crisp and beautiful, and the sound is only tinny out of the box. Just like the tint, you must go into the menu and adjust everything to your personal liking. Once we struck the balance we liked for all the options (in about 10 minutes)--we were watching the most amazing picture and sound we&#39;ve ever owned. And we even attached one of those new flat panel amplifying antennas since we don&#39;t have cable, dish, etc. I am uber satisfied with this purchase. Yes, I&#39;ve only had it a few days, but it doesn&#39;t shut off by itself (it&#39;ll only do that if somebody inadvertently sets the sleep timer OR if you are on a &#34;no signal&#34; station for 5 mins. I also read among the reviews that people felt compelled to hook up their computer speakers to amp up the volume...I can&#39;t imagine why because it is so clear and loud on its very own that it isn&#39;t even remotely necessary IMO. My 14 YO son said the same thing--why would anybody deem that necessary? Perhaps there are some &#34;lemon&#34; tvs out there just like cars, but mine sure doesn&#39;t appear to be 1 of them. I highly recommend this acquisition, folks. :)	4.0	10/4/2011
walmart.com	I got this on sale from Walmart.com--under $200 including tax. I would have rated it higher but the instruction book is not overly clear. It looks like it would be but once you start actually trying to follow the instructions, not so much. We had a hard time getting it hooked up so it would play. We did eventually figure it out and have been really happy with the picture quality. The sound is okay but we&#39;ve had a little trouble hitting the sweet spot between too loud and &#34;Huh?&#34;. We still haven&#39;t figured out how to hook up the Xbox to the TV without having to disconnect part of the cable. Granted, we haven&#39;t spent a lot of time in trying to figure it out so far. One thing that contributed to the confusion is that they label the cable function as YPbPr. I don&#39;t get why they can&#39;t just call it &#34;Cable&#34;. Once we finally got it set up, we really love the TV. I&#39;d recommend it but be prepared to do some cussing and fiddling around to get it connected and working.	1.0	2/18/2014

walmart.com	Been using the TV for the past week and seems to be good so far. For the price I pay, I am quite impressed with the Color and Sound of the TV as compared to my other higher price TV.	1.0	3/7/2011

walmart.com	I have owned this TV for 4 months, now. I wasn&#39;t even aware what &#34;brand&#34; Sceptre was, but I was in desperate need of a new TV, and had a limited budget. I purchased this TV right at $190+tax ship2store. I couldn&#39;t be happier with it! To be honest, I don&#39;t use my TV a lot. Mostly college football games, the occasional video game, and I have a Roku 2 XL box that I also stream Amazon Prime movies with. I may go an entire week without even turning the TV on. So the TV, in general, is not being heavily used. The box that the TV arrives in is huge. The TV itself is pretty big, once it&#39;s out of the box and on the stand. Setup was a breeze. I don&#39;t have cable, but I do have an antenna. And with the digital tuner, my local channels come in crystal clear. It will take some time to get the settings just the way you like them. And if the TV is unplugged for any reason, the settings reset, which was a letdown. The 3 hdmi ports are more than enough for me, but others may feel they need additional outlets. The overall picture quality is above average. The contrast ratio is only 3000:1 (compared to an LG 32&#34; which is 70,000:1), so you&#39;ll get what you pay for. The audio does seem a bit low for different channels, so you&#39;ll find yourself with the remote in hand, readjusting the volume settings regularly. All-in-all, I would recommend this TV to any that wants to add an nice flat screen TV to accent any room. I would not recommend this for gamers or anyone wanting a complete HD experience. :)	5.0	3/12/2014
walmart.com	This tv was great for the price. The picture is nice and the sound is loud. I was very happy with it until it died. I bought this in May 2012 in April 2013 it would power on but there was no picture or sound. I still had 2 weeks before the warranty ran out. I filled out Sceptre&#39;s rma form online. They emailed me a prepaid shipping label, I had saved my original packaging so I didn&#39;t have to wait for them to send a box. It took a week to ship across country to them, a week to fix it and a week to get back to me. The process was very easy. It seems to be working fine now, we&#39;ll see how long it lasts. If you&#39;re going to buy this tv do yourself a favor and pay for it with a credit card that will extend the manufacturer&#39;s warranty for an extra year.	1.0	3/21/2014
walmart.com	The 3.5mm audio jack in the back didn&#39;t work, makes a weird noise. The lowest volume level is too loud at night. Picture was a bit pixel-y at times, like when there is movement on the screen it drags a little. The tv eventually died after 15 months. I imagine people who left a good review didn&#39; bother coming back when they had a problem later. After researching on the web, many other people have had the same issues. Since it is outside of warranty, Sceptre won&#39;t help. Don&#39;t fall into the same hole I fell in.	4.0	12/27/2011
walmart.com	Not a bad tv for the price but not a great deal. My main complaint is that there is no full screen option. If you go to cinema it cuts part of the picture off.and if you go to zoom the picture is not clear.	1.0	3/14/2011
walmart.com	The picture quality is horrible on this tv. It&#39;s like watching through fog- we will be returning it asap. The price was good but not good enough for this mess. Also the tv won&#39;t sync with Dish tv remote.	1.0	4/1/2011
walmart.com	1 year to the date, either the backlight or the power supply has gone bad. This is what I&#39;ve figured out by reading online forums with other people having the same issue. The center of the screen went very dim but the edges seem okay. Yeah, it&#39;s a great deal for a TV that size but if it&#39;s dead exactly one year later it&#39;s not a good bargain. Also, the manufacturer&#39;s web site is useless for finding answers or getting help. They really don&#39;t even have a functioning web site. That should tell you all you need to know about the Spectre brand.	Menu	5/1/2011

I was nervous because it isn&#39;t a name brand, and since I could only view it online I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. This price is by far the cheapest out there for size and specs it has. I am so glad I took a chance and bought this tv! I am sitting in font of it right now and this picture is perfect! Someone mentioned in there review that the sound isn&#39;t good, but I have to disagree, The sound is beautiful!

walmart.com	This is the second of two TVs I bought from Walmart. The first was a Viore 32&#34; Class LCD 1080p 60Hz HDTV, LC32VF56, but is now out of stock and may not be available again. The Viore had good reviews and I agree that it is a low priced, high-quality TV for $299. I was going to get two of them, but wanted to make sure it was what I wanted before buying the second one, and two weeks later it was out of stock. After some consideration that include a 37&#34; Viore I got the Sceptre despite it being a 720p. I own a Sceptre 22&#34; computer monitor that has been good so I was not too worried about the brand. I am using both of these TVs side by side as COMPUTER MONITORS! I needed some big monitors and if you by just a monitor they are more expensive. This way I have great monitors and they can also show TV, DVDs, and photos on USB flash memory. More value, less money. The 1080p should be your first choice as the resolution is higher. For me, the second monitor is 720p and it&#39;s ok. For HD TV I can&#39;t really tell the difference, but I have not watched them both at the same time. HDTV is very nice on both. The sound is a little better on the Viore than the Sceptre. Playing with the controls may help, but other reviews said the same thing. Don&#39;t expect HI-FI audio. Both work well with even a cheap antenna and I $20 rotator seemed ro bring in all the possible broadcast stations in my area. Non-HD is ok, and the HD looks great. I bought the extended service plan for both TVs. I don&#39;t normally do this, but I will be using them a lot every day and at $20 each for 2 years it&#39;s cheap insurance. If you buy a more expensive TV the coverage may be more. To use as a monitor for best results, make sure your video card can display 1360 by 768. I turn down the brightness as much as possible on all my monitors. The reason is it should make the backlight lamp last longer as I is the most likely thing to fail over time.	5.0	7/27/2011
walmart.com	I understand that you cannot beat this price but for 80 dollars more i can get a real name brand like toshiba or vizio and get full 1080p and much better sound quality.

walmart.com	I needed a low cost TV and this was in the right price range. I wasn&#39;t expecting much. But this turned out to be a very good purchace. Sound is good with an equlizer built into the set and the audio is run through HDMi, no RCA cords at all. Picture is good, I didn&#39;t adjust to the User settings, the factory settings are really good on this set. I can see the picture from the side well and as an added bonus the base swivels 30 degrees each way. I set this unit on my coffee table and can swivel it so I can watch It while I cook in the kitchen 20 feet away and the picture is still good. Easy to set up and they even put a nice little screw driver in with it. I was watching football 10 minutes out of the box! Remote works well, and they included a nice list of remote codes so it is easily programmable. I also got the extended warranty so I&#39;m good for the next 4 years. I purchased it online and it was delivered 3 days later right to my door. I am pleased.	5.0	1/1/2012

walmart.com	I ordered this TV thinking I would use it in our bedroom. After two days I knew it would end up as a guest room television. Picture is fine, although a tad dim when compared to our other flat panel TVs. Our biggest issue, &amp; one that makes me consider returning it to Wal-mart, is the poor sound quality. In fact we had to turn it to the maximum setting on one show to even hear above the central heat running. The speaker is quite tinny sounding. While it doesn&#39;t always require you to turn it up that high to hear, it does require it frequently. It&#39;s going to the spare bedroom and we&#39;re going with a name brand for the bedroom. I would spend the extra $50 and get an RCA or Vizio.	5.0	12/29/2012

Do not buy this product!!!! It is unreliable. If you consider the time it takes to unbox, assemble, wall mount, deal with customer service when it fails, remove it from the wall and return it you have invested more time and money than the cost of the most expensive TV on the market. Save yourself lots of inconvenience and buy a quality set.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	9/1/2011

One TV stopped working within the 90 day return policy with Walmart, so returning it was a breeze. The other 2 are having to go through Sceptre&#39;s &#34;so called&#34; warranty services and it&#39;s a total joke! They hold the customer responsible for shipping both ways, so it&#39;s going to be close to $90 for shipping alone, and the wait time I was quoted was 4-6 months for repairs.

We turned it on, it displayed the logo and then faded black. So we used the warranty service. Last week received a letter saying it couldn&#39;t be fixed and we were being sent a check.

The problem I have, 3 pixels that are stuck one red, one blue, and one green, not dead. Not a huge problem but very frustrating that something brand new doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;m hoping that as we use the TV they will unstick themselves. It will be returned in a few weeks before the 90 day return policy is up if they don&#39;t fix themselves with use.

walmart.com	Had TV for about one week from 11/7/13. Picture looks great. The only issue I have with this TV is it does not have separate RCA plugs for the video game.

This would be a benefit.	4.0	8/10/2011

walmart.com	Finally came out of the &#39;90&#39;s with this TV. Did not want to spend much, so was willing to forgo a few bells &amp; whistles. After researching, I learned that the 720p picture quality is indiscernible from the 1080p (unless you&#39;re sitting right next to it, and who does that?), and the fact that this TV does not have wireless built in was a non-issue since our satellite TV receiver has wi-fi. Had an issue with the sound at first, having to constantly adjust volume up and down, but after communicating with Sceptre&#39;s tech dept., learned that AVL (automatic volume level) should be turned off for sound consistency (AVL gives you that &#34;theater&#34; sound, where the music seems ultra loud compared with voices). Since turning off AVL we have enjoyed it much more. After a couple of weeks of viewing, we are very happy with our purchase (on sale at Walmart.com), delivered free to our front door.	3.0	12/11/2013
walmart.com	I purchased because it was made in America and the cost was great. However, Sceptre is not on the Comcast list so I have to use 2 remotes to watch TV.

I love that it swivels. I definitely would recommend buying this product.	1.0	6/19/2011

walmart.com	I bought this TV 2 years ago; it seemed pretty good for the money. It just died (went black when turned on - had to unplug to turn off). Apparently this Scepter TV has a defect that a lot of folks have experienced over time. Perhaps the capacitors blew out (which is what some say); the tv repair man quoted $100 to fix - isn&#39;t worth it. If you are clever with a soldering iron, perhaps you could fix it yourself with a kit. Consider that many TVs will last quite a few years - this one didn&#39;t for me and many other Scepter owners. Consider a different manufacturer. The Scepter Tech support phone line never answers the phone, nor can you leave a message.	1.0	11/18/2011

walmart.com	I bought this TV for my bedroom. It was fine until about 5 months later - then the picture went completely out. The sound still works fine. I did a little more research online, and it seems that this TV is notorious for breaking in some kind of way. Of course Walmart doesn&#39;t carry the warranty, so you have to pay to send it off to get fixed, then pay for them to fix it, and then pay to have it shipped back to you.

Contacted sceptre and they said to send it back to them; after a few weeks of not hearing anything I contacted them and they said they couldnt fix it and would be sending me a replacement tv. After about another 2 weeks I finally received it. We have had the replacement one for 1 month and now it has dark lines running across the screen. So in 3 months we have went through 2 new tvs. This is absolutely ridiculous! Do not buy this tv unless you want one that only works for a few weeks.	1.0	11/8/2013

I followed the instructions but it was loose so I took it apart and followed the instructions again. It was still loose. Other than this the product meets all the standards it stated. The color is great and the sound is great. I look forward to many enjoyable hours watching it as I sew. I put it in my sewing room to keep me company while I sew.	5.0	6/24/2014

walmart.com	2nd one i have bought in last few years. Bought an element in store and carried back to get this Sceptre. One in bedroom and one at a weekend cabin. Watch a good bit of concert dvd&#39;s and sports. Sound is fine as well as picture. I own a vizio flat screen and enjoy this one just as much. Not sure on the life of it yet, but for the money if i get 5 plus years out of it, i can throw it away when she quits breathing!	Toggle Search	11/8/2012
walmart.com	Bought 2 at the same time. Cheap TVs mean we can buy new ones with no regrets when these die. Quick and easy set up. Crisp picture. Bedroom set sounds great in a corner. Living room set sounds tinny and spreads outward, not forward. It&#39;s against a flat wall and we have an open floor plan. I adjusted the sound over several days, which helps, but we&#39;re going to need some extra sound equipment for the living room set. I wish the &#34;guide&#34; and the &#34;info&#34; information were combined. The clock settings are NOT great - we&#39;re in the Central Time Zone, but the 2 TV&#39;s show 2 different time settings (even on &#34;guide&#34; vs. &#34;info.&#34;), even though they&#39;re set the exact same way. It&#39;s frustrating, but we rarely watch TV programs (we do DVD&#39;s &amp; Netflix) so it&#39;s not a big deal. If you&#39;re going from an older TV &amp; aren&#39;t an avid viewer, the 720P/60Hz will be fine. No need to go for 1080/120. If you want to do any Internet stuff w/ it (i.e., Netflix, Youtube, etc.), you&#39;ll need an HDMI cable and a box - you can pick one up in any electronic dept. Overall happy with them.	Walmart.

walmart.com	I was a big fan of Sceptre for awhile now, and bought monitors and TV&#39;s from them religiously. However, I have now had 4 go bad on me, including one of these, and in less than a year under normal wear and tear. I cannot in good faith recommend this brand anymore, as the quality and durability seems to be inadequate anymore. Price and functionality are good, but I can&#39;t rely on these products anymore and am afraid to buy any more of their stuff. My 42 inch went bad, a 24 inch monitor went bad, a 32 inch went bad and now this one went bad, at least it was less than a year old so I am going to try to get a new one under warranty. I wish I could rate it higher, as it is always nice to have a brand that you can trust and a good price, however either I got a few bad one&#39;s or Sceptre is delivering inadequate products anymore, either way, good luck if you choose this brand and model, it seems to be a toss of the dice anymore.

walmart.com	I bought this TV a couple of months ago. My experience with Walmart was fine and dandy. The TV was great for a while. But after three months, my TV just died. It had no reason; I had it in my room and I used it only a couple of hours per day. One day, I turned it on, I got a faint smell of something burning and the picture was gone; I only had sound. (It didn&#39;t catch on fire, it was probably something that ave in inside the TV). Walmart doesn&#39;t cover a product after a month of purchase so I had to contact Sceptre and let me tell you: worst customer service ever!!!! You have a hard time contacting a representative, either by phone or email. When you do, it&#39;s a guy that speaks broken English and only gives you what looks like prerecorded answers. They expect you to save the original box so you can send it for repairs. if you don&#39;t, they&#39;ll send you one WHEN they feel like sending you one and IF it arrives. Again, it&#39;s not Walmart&#39;s fault. And I have never ever had problems with any TV until now. So buy at your own risk.	Invalid city, state or zip code	11/22/2013
walmart.com	We bought this TV because the name brand that we recognized that was a great deal was, of course, sold out online. We hooked it up and it worked beautifully - the first night. Starting the second morning the TV would come on for a few seconds then blink off for a few, then come back onto the channel for a few seconds, then blink off. We called tech support three different days and always got a message machine. They never called us back so we boxed the TV up and traded it in for an Emerson. Be careful, if you buy this for the good deal, there does not seem to be customer service or tech support!	4.0	3/23/2011
walmart.com	TV is for bedroom on basic cable no box. The tv was packaged beautifully. Everything was in resealabe plastic bags. Came with cleaning cloth for the screen. Set up was a breeze.

walmart.com	I&#39;d been chomping at the bit to upgrade from my old 19&#34; tube TV to a flat panel HDTV for a long, looooong time. My first thought was that I didn&#39;t want anything smaller than 37&#34;, and nothing with less than 1080p. When I found this deal online, however, I decided I could probably live with a 32&#34;, 720p television. Was I right or what? I hadn&#39;t taken into account how small my living room is, and I do believe anything larger than this would have been overwhelming in it; and the 720p is far superior to what I&#39;d been watching, even without an HD source. This is the perfect TV for me - just the right size and with enough clarity to make me just sit with my chin in my hand and sigh. It was light enough for me to carry from my car into my apartment with no difficulty whatsoever, and set up from entering my apartment to unpackaging the TV to having it sitting on my TV stand watching television was less than 20 minutes. I definitely recommend this for those who want a lot for a little money!	5.0	10/8/2013
walmart.com	We bought this in February and I fell in love with it. I like the way the sound works on it. It&#39;s not going to blow out the windows but for what I needed it for it was fine. I loved the fact that it had a headphone jack, for a standard headset which I was hard pressed to find in a tv in this size. The picture was great, very clear, easy to adjust. It has THREE HMDI ports, along with a USB, DVI, and a number of other ports. It had a sturdy stand, and a mounting plate on the back. It has a lot of screen aspect ratios for different uses. Until this month this thing was perfect and I would have recommended it to anyone. But this month it&#39;s developed what I have come to find out is a big problem with this brand. It&#39;s flicking off on the screen but not the sound every few minutes. It started out every half hour or so, now it&#39;s every 5 minutes or less, for a few seconds. From what I&#39;ve found out its probably a power supply problem, something about bulging or bursting capacitors and they are a pain in the rump to replace. I am going to have to replace it, and unfortunately it probably won&#39;t be this brand. I really wish I could recommend this tv because until this happened I really loved this thing.	4.0	12/30/2011
walmart.com	I needed a TV for my bedroom and this was the cheapest one I could find. I&#39;m not super picky, so I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have a problem with the mentioned low quality picture and sound, which I don&#39;t. I have two problems. One, the remote. I have no idea why, but the remote doesn&#39;t work sometimes (I&#39;ve tried changing the batteries and all that). It only happens when I&#39;m playing DVDs. I&#39;ll try to change the volume and it just won&#39;t respond. This was happening early on, but I attributed it to the fact that I was switching between my DVD player and Wii, but I&#39;m not anymore and it still does it. Second, my DVD player and Wii both use the same ports to connect and there is only one set of those ports, but multiple HDMI ports (of which none of my devices use). I have to unplug one device to use the other.	2.0	1/18/2012

walmart.com	I bought my TV from Walmart (this has nothing to do with walmart service) about 2 months ago. I went to turn my TV on and the led light blew out after only 2 months. After I went on to sceptres website (which was a joke) I found out it only had a 90 day warranty (another joke) and luckily mine had blown out before my 90 days were up. I tried calling and emailing sceptre to see how I could return or get the tv fixed, it took 3 days to get anyone to answer me. They finally sent me a box to ship the TV to them and when the box got here I realized that they were going to make me pay for shipping; which would have cost more than the TV itself. So i brought the tv back to Walmart and thank god they were able to take it back. So a big thanks to Walmart and a lesson learned to buy from a new brand. You get what you pay for. I would not recommend this brand to anyone.	4.0	6/24/2011

I bought this tv in May and I now have to unplug and plug back in about 10 times to get the picture to come on. It&#39;s not worth the return shipping to use the warranty so I will be purchasing a different tv. Make sure to do your research before buying a tv and pay a little more to get a better brand.	1.0	12/10/2011

walmart.com	I hate having to replace loyal old electronics like televisions, but, it has to be done sometimes. My huge, old, heavy Toshiba t.v. finally died. Rats. Walmart to the rescue! I wanted a decent size unit to replace my old living room set. This television fits every single bill for me. I love it. It was even delivered three days before expected, which was awesome, and an absolute breeze to set up. I can actually pick this thing up and move it around without help. I can&#39;t even get my old t.v. out to the curb because its so heavy. The only problem I have with it, and it probably isn&#39;t an issue with the t.v., but with the cable company, is that I can&#39;t configure the television to work with my cable&#39;s remote (Comcast.) I have no clue what code to use, but I&#39;ll see if Comcast has a solution. The set has great resolution and sound. I really love it!	5.0	2/26/2014
walmart.com	I bought this to be used as an occasional TV at an apartment that my wife and I use out of town. It was cheap and I figured worth the risk. I unboxed and connected at our house just to try it out before taking to the apartment. My wife and I were so surprised at how good the quality was that we&#39;ve kept it in our bedroom as a TV we use quite often. The picture quality is very good. It has multiple settings you can tweak to make it just as desired. The sound quality while not superior is very good and we definitely have no problems with any movie our game used with it. The TV has muliple conneciton points and I believe 3 HDMI ports. We have it connected to an HD receiver and gaming system and are very satisfied with the overall quality. My only problem is that I wished I had bought 2 so that I&#39;d have one to take to the apartment now.	5.0	8/22/2014

I brought it home, unpacked it, followed the directions for assembly and hook up. When I turned it on, I got a brief glimpse of the Scepter Logo as the picture flickered off and on. Thinking it only needed to &#34;warm up&#34; I finally got the settings made so I could see the TV and off it went! Nothing but a black screen and no sound. I called Sceptre Customer Support TWICE and both men I talked to said it was a DEFECTIVE SET and to take it back. I took it back and got a refund. I would not recommend this TV. It looks good, great features and fantastic price but if it doesn&#39;t work, none of that makes any difference!	1.0	12/24/2011

walmart.com	I bought this tv in April 2012 because it was cheap for its&#39; size. After about 7 weeks I found out why. The picture shorted and the screen remained black when I turned the power on. So I sent it back to the manufacturer under the limited warranty so they could fix it. It took about a month for them to send it back fixed. Then today I came home and tried to turn it on. The sound came on but the screen remained black. After about 30 seconds of the tv being on, it filled the entire bedroom and bathroom with a horrific smell of burning plastic. So in 7 months I have to pay to ship this back to the manufatcturer to get it when and I have no assurances that even though this tv still falls under the one year limited warranty that they will even be willing to fix it a second time. Save yourself the time and aggrevation. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND OF TV! IT IS WORTHLESS!!!!	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/5/2013

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s still under warranty but that&#39;s just a whole bunch of hassle I don&#39;t have time for. I would sooner just buy a new TV from a trusted name brand.

My wife took all the info to our local Walmart and was told the only way to get the new price was to return the items and reorder.

As for the Sceptre 32&#34;....what&#39;s not to like. I see a lot of people complaining about the sound of their tv&#39;s.

walmart.com	Setting: Christmas morning. T.V. was fairly easy to set up. I was actually impressed with the picture while it was working. The speaker on the left side vibrated horribly at about 2/3 of the volume. Even after I adjusted the &#34;EQ&#34;, it still had the sound of a transistor radio. If I held the left side with my hand it would stop. About the 5th time I turned the unit on, it just petered out. After that the only thing I could get it to do was change the power light from red to blue. This is probably an extreme case for this product, but I believe when it comes to electronics you should aim for higher quality than this. My dad was looking for an inexpensive flatscreen for my Mom and what he got was a high dollar paper weight. If you decide to go with the Sceptre (which I now call the De-Sceptre), I would definitely buy the extended warranty.....but really, why bother.	Clear search field	8/26/2011

walmart.com	I have been shopping around for a flat screen and have not been successful but then my aunt suggested that I check Walmart.com because I had done a great deal of my Xmas shopping there...I did as she suggested and found a nice Sony on sale but I ended up with the Sceptre piece of junk because she decided to buy it for me as a gift. I was so happy that i had finally got my flat screen...I hooked it up two days after and was satisfied...later that same night, the screen went blank but the TV&#39;s power was still on...I played around with the settings and it stopped going blank...i thought that was it...during the night, it went blank 3more times but i thought i was because i was leaning on the remote...I removed the remote from the bed...when i awoke the next morning, the tv wouldnt stay on for even 3mins at a time...i called the company and they are just calling me back 10mins ago..(3days later), not to mention that the manufacturers customer service reps are so rude ...i am so disappointed...I cant watch tv, play movies or video games...i am mad at Walmart for carrying a piece of junk like this tv...how ever Walmart has agreed to take back the television although i have thrown away the box so all is forgiven... tomorrow I will go to Walmart and purchase a better quality television... IF YOU VALUE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY....&#34;SAY NO TO SCEPTRE!!!&#34;	Items in cart	12/27/2011
walmart.com	I purchased this television for my husband for the bedroom. I have returned it and purchased a VIZIO for a little more money at Target. The sound and picture on the Sceptre were poor. The sound was tinny and the color was dull. Waited a long time for a different TV and wasn&#39;t going to settle for the Sceptre. Very disappointed because I relied on the reviews so had to go through the hassle of standing in line to return the product.	Enter city, state or zip code	12/30/2011
walmart.com	I ordered this television through the ship to store feature on walmart.com. Upon receiving the television and taking it back home, I found that there was no picture AT ALL on the screen. When I called Sceptre&#39;s customer service line, it was obvious that the CSR had heard of a lot of these televisions were shipped DOA or that he received a lot of the same calls from other customers. This television is garbage; spend an extra $150-$200 and go with a real television producer. I will never buy from Sceptre again.	Invalid city, state or zip code	5/14/2012
walmart.com	I bought this tv for my daughter&#39;s birthday and after two weeks the screen started malfunctioning. When the tv is turned on the logo will flash for just a second and the screen will go black with only the sound working. I can repeatedly turn it on and off and eventually it will start working again. After several attempts to reach Sceptre customer service and going to voicemail with no calls back I am returning it.	4.0	9/27/2012
walmart.com	At first we thought we had a great deal. Nice picture, good sound. Perfect for the bedroom. But after two weeks the picture would not come on. We turned it off and then back on, and it worked. a week later we lost the picture again. Only this time the picture never came back. Only the sound.	4.0	12/5/2012
walmart.com	We bought this TV in December! Here it is April---4 months later, and it quit working altogether. First it just kept shutting itself off, then it just refused to come back on. We are trying to deal with Sceptre to get it repaired. Probably have to pay a bunch just to get it shipped to Sceptor. Plus it&#39;s supposed to be sent back in it&#39;s original box with original packaging materials. Who keeps that ??We obviously had thrown that away. So, I&#39;m not feeling very confident about getting my TV repaired! My advice to anyone is DO NOT waste your time and money on this TV! I&#39;ll probably end up at a local dealer, paying more, but getting a better product!	3.0	11/10/2013

walmart.com	I purchased two of these televisions and they seemed okay but one of them stopped working after about 3.5 months, I could not get a picture. I did not purchase an extra warranty and of course the 90 day replacement warranty had expired so I had to buy another T.V. Even though the other one that I purchased is still working the quality is just not worth it for the price.	1.0	2/27/2012

walmart.com	I am sorry to say this but invest in this TV is a waste of time. I bought three of these tvs in the same day and when I took them to my house only one of them came with damage I could listen it but not showed any image. I returned it to the store and they gave me my money back and as I ignored the signals and keep the others 2 tvs and go and I bought other to replace the damage one. After four months one by one these TVs were losing the image. Be prepared to pay for shipping and handling after four months of having it with you. The image disappears and you can only hear the sound. When I tried to solve the problem with them, they send me empties boxes to return the TVs. They fixed them but meanwhile nobody returns me the time that I spent on these and the fact of be carrying these TVs from one side to other and also I had to pay for shipping and handling. This is the worst investment of my life I end up paying what I would spend in TVs of a recognized brand. Do not invest money in these tvs and if you like to buy it please keep the box for when you have to send it back for repair.	1.0	11/11/2011
walmart.com	this TV is not worth money. I have owned the tv for less than a year and guess what I turned it on today and now it doesn&#39;t work at all.

walmart.com	we bought this tv 5 months ago and one morning we turned it on and the picture went out of it,had voice but no pic.2 times since we got it I turned it on and nothing came on,so I unplugged it for a minute and turned it back on and that worked.This time nothing worked.we called the company 2 times and of course no answer and no call back!! We feel the tv should last more than 5 months!!	5.0	10/2/2013
walmart.com	I thought the price was very appealing. I had read a few reviews and I thought for the price of the tv the rating was reasonable. So I bought this item and it was shipped to the store right away. The hubby picked it up while I was out of town. When I got back in I set it up. The packaging was great they even included a screw driver which I thought was good idea. The stand was a little flimsy and the tv wobbles even though I was sure to secure the screws well. I hooked up my roku player and the sound is great. However, every 30 seconds to 2 mins the picture was just going out but the sound stayed on. So I hooked up my laptop to see if maybe it was connection. That kept shutting off as well. I figured maybe there was a setting that needed to be adjusted.Nope!!!!. So this evening we will be lugging this junker back to Walmart. That&#39;s what I get for being cheap.	5.0	3/20/2011

walmart.com	This TV did not work at all. On Christmas day when my son, who this was a gift for, plugged it up to connect it the picture came in for 2 seconds and blacked out. He turned it off and on several times and got the same thing. The TV would not stay on. I returned it to Walmart the day after Christmas and wasn&#39;t able to purchase another TV from Walmart in the same price range. I went to BEST Buy to purchase a TV that worked.	5.0	11/28/2011

walmart.com	While a good price, and not bad for a bedroom; we were very disappointed in the sound quality of this TV. It is very tinny - probably because the speakers are at the back and facing down. Not sure that I would recommend this for daily use or to a friend for purchase.	1.0	3/29/2012

walmart.com	I looked at all the great reviews on this before purchase. The features of the tv were good in terms of the packaging, setup, types of inputs and even the picture for the limited time we watched it. Price obviously seemed good as well. The sound was pretty bad though. I&#39;ve had my share of LCD/LED TVs, so it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand that the sound isn&#39;t great on the TVs. The issue was with this unit. The different tones or whatever were very different in terms of the sound output. You would have to turn it up to hear some things in the same show and other parts of the same show would be very loud. My wife noticed it as soon as we plugged it in. It&#39;s not worth a little cheaper of a unit if it&#39;s this bad. I am returning this and will be getting another Samsung, which I&#39;ve loved in our living room.	5.0	4/16/2012

walmart.com	I bought this TV and had it a total of two weeks. It began pretty good; picture was not that hot but for a $200 set it was decent. After the first week, the volume began acting up; you would have to mute the set then un-mute the set before you could adjust the volume. After that, a small line of malfunctioning pixels started showing up in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and grew until it was about half the screen. I returned it to my local Wal Mart and am looking into a different replacement.	Toggle Search	4/26/2012

No picture, smell of burning wires. Dead. Sometimes, when something seems too good to be true, it really is. Buyer beware.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	6/30/2012
walmart.com	I bought this as a replacement for a broken tv. It seamed to have good review around the web and the price was in my budget. It worked ok for 2 months. Then this morning the screen is BLACK and i can hear the nice news lady giving me my morning weather report but there is not sound. I checked the manufacures webs site and they said unplug it for 10 min and try again. Still nothing. So i try and call and it just rings into a service that asks you to leave a message and someone will call you back. There is no live chat will almost 9am PST but im not holding out hope that someone will acutally be on it. I&#39;ve printed out my return code and taking it back to Walmart after kids off to school. Am very disapointed that this seams to be a VERY common problem with this TV. I should have read more review before buying it but to find that the most common complaint besides picture is a BLACK screen i will never buy this brand again.	Clear search field	8/29/2012

walmart.com	I had never heard of the brand but the size was what I was looking to buy and the price blew the competition out of the water. It took a phone call to my server to get the digital channels to load but once done, I am very pleased with the quality of this product for the money. Picture is clear and sound is stronger than most flat screen televisions without additional sound implements. I bought this for our bedroom and only expected to watch it a for a few minutes before I went to sleep at night, but it is so clear and easy to watch, I sometimes crawl up on the bed in the middle of the day to watch a show instead of watching the big screen in our family room.	4.0	11/28/2013

walmart.com	This TV was very easy to put together &amp; install. I choose it for the affordable price &amp; because it allows me to install a headset.

So far she seems to be happy.	3.0	12/4/2011
walmart.com	I was really skeptical on purchasing this TV mainly because of the name brand. Never heard of it and wasn&#39;t sure of its quality. I needed a TV to replace the 32&#34; tube TV in my kids room, because I needed a space saver and wanted something safer for my 7 and 5 yr old versus that big TV they had. Upon reading the reviews, I took my chances and bought it. I am more than happy with my purchase and didn&#39;t really need much in a TV except to watch TV, DVDs, and play video games. Had it set up within minutes and was not complicated at all. The picture is fine and the audio is great as well. The one small complaint that I have is that the attachment to the base is a bit wiggly and I feel like it could break if someone puts too much pressure on top of the side of it. Other than that, it serves it purpose! It is lightweight, comes with a remote, has a sleep timer on it, and other basic features. I really like how it swivels, which makes it easy for my kids to adjust it without moving the whole TV. I plan on buying another here soon!! If you are looking for a TV that is simple, basic, and not looking for a whole lot...then this is the TV for you.	2.0	1/19/2012
walmart.com	This TV replaces an old Sharp tv that I&#39;ve had for about 10 years. The Sharp is about the same size screen, but there the similarity ends. The Sharp is so heavy I can&#39;t pick it up or move it. This one is doable. It does have a great picture. You can select your choice of picture styles. The &#34;Normal&#34; is the square style like the old tvs. It leaves a lot of black space around the picture, but it has the best picture because it is close to what is broadcast. The &#34;Wide&#34; style usually fills up the screen. Since it must stretch the picture a bit to fill the screen, it causes a bit of distortion, but I like it best because it is a really big picture. My personal preference. There are other options, like &#34;cinema&#34;, which I have not tried. There are plenty of options for sound too. I had absolutely no trouble hooking up this new tv and getting it going. I have Dish, and as another reviewer mentioned, Sony codes work for setting the Dish remote up for this tv. As others have mentioned the sound is not great. I bought the sound bar to go with this, and now it sounds fabulous! As for price, you can&#39;t beat the price. I paid twice as much for my old tv.	1.0	2/19/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my mother who just moved to a nursing home. She uses wireless headphones to hear the TV and immediately we found that the Samsung TV in her room did not have the audio-out (RJ) jacks needed to connect the headphones. We had just purchased a 50&#34; Spectre TV for our living room and her headphones had plugged in and worked perfectly on the first try, so I simply came back to Walmart.com and ordered this one, a little smaller to fit in her room, but with the same audio-out jacks needed for the headphones. A great value, a great solution for the headphone issue! It&#39;s very hard to find a TV with these additional jacks, so look to Spectre if you&#39;re having the same problem.	Walmart. Save Money.

I could connect it to a sound system, but if their quality control folks gave these speakers a &#34;passed&#34; rating, how confident can I be about the rest of the TV? I took a chance and I lost. This one is going back to Walmart pronto. Bascially you&#39;re flipping a coin if you decide to buy this unit.

I tried everything and even called technical support (after repeated calls going straight to voicemail) but I was unsuccessful. I decided to return both tv&#39;s even though I only had problems with one of them. I never heard of the sceptre brand before so I figured you get what you pay for. I paid an extra 100 bucks and got 2 tv&#39;s that were a better brand. So glad I did!!	1.0	8/28/2014
walmart.com	YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING, JUST READ THE OTHER REVIEWS. FOR SOME PEOPLE THE TV WORKED FINE, BUT FOR OTHERS NOT SO GOOD. I ADMIT, I WAS BEING CHEAP AND AS A RESULT, THE TV STARTED SHOWING A BURY PICTURE AFTER ONE WEEK! I AM ACTUALLY RETURNING THE TV TODAY AND WILL ADD SOME MORE MONEY AND BUY A BETTER WELL KNOWN BRAND. THIS BRAND IS USED OR USE TO BE USED MOSTLY AS COMPUTER MONITORS. I COULDN&#39;T FIND THE TV CODE FOR THIS BRAND TO PROGRAM IT TO MY CABLE REMOTE, HA. OVERALL THE TV IS CHEAP AND APPEARS TO BE A GREAT BUY, BUT I WOULD ADD MORE MONEY AND BUY A BETTER BRAND.	1.0	8/29/2014

walmart.com	I bought this television and when i set it up, was disappointed with the grainy picture quality. After a while I got used to it though as &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34; The sound was also tinny and distant. All of which I could deal with as it was just an extra television for the bedroom. After about three weeks, the picture and sound just stopped working. Thankfully, WalMart has an excellent return policy if within the 90 days. I do not advise wasting your time with this television.	1.0	12/23/2011

I guess I wasnt too suprised when i hooked it up and the picture was green and distorted, the remote was light weight and looked liked a childrens toy, did not give the feeling of qualty in design. I took it back and got an Element brand TV for $10 more and it works great and looks and feels like a quality product. Spend the extra few bucks on an Element. Skip the Spectre brand.	Walmart.

walmart.com	TV lasted approx. 2 months, was working fine except for sound quality. Went to turn it on and the rear of the TV panel flashed then the screen went blank. TV still had power on the LED and there was a burnt smell. Tried to unplug then wait a while but the screen and audio did not work anymore. Brought the walmart service plan thinking I could avoid manufacturer hassles. My mistake, it only takes effect after the manufacturers warranty. Got in touch with Sceptre customer service, they basically said I could just send it back, even though shipping would be covered (I think), I would&#39;ve had to pay extra to insure it along with confirmation. Said forget that and just returned it to the store since it was within the 90 day. Went with the 32&#34; Vizio that was $50 more. MUCH BETTER TV, known quality brand, better audio and picture, TV does not feel as flimsy as the 32&#34; Sceptre LCD. Well worth it, you get what you pay for.	Search	10/30/2012

walmart.com	My overall rating is one star because of their service. I would not purchase this TV. I got this TV in May 2012 and in February 2013 the picture went out. Just a black screen I could only hear sound. I contacted Sceptre, and they issued me a RMA# and a shipping label(that I had to print from my email) and I had to pack up the TV, and take it to my local UPS store and have it shipped. They are based in CA so it took 5days to get there. They so-called replaced the power board and shipped it back to me the day after they got it which took another 5days to get back. I got it back, used it for 2 days, turned it on the 3rd day and was having the SAME ISSUE. I emailed them and did not receive a response back so I called only for them to tell me I must go thru the same process again.(pack, ship, wait) They told me other then this process, there is nothing they can do for me. I reminded them that I already gave them a chance to fix it and they failed so why would I want to trust that they would repair it this time and his response to me was &#34;lets not think that far ahead and assume they wont fix it the 2nd time&#34; I know the price is great but it&#39;s really not worth the hassle of shipping this large TV back and forth to CA. Buy a brand that is known and trusted and stands by good customer service.	5.0	5/10/2012

walmart.com	We bought this TV for parents who finally agreed to replace their fully functional 15-year old CRTs. So, the price was a major consideration; advanced features were *not*. I don&#39;t think you can find a better 32&#34; for $230 (I don&#39;t think you could find *any* 32&#34; for $240; although I am sure there will be something shortly). It has 3 HDMI ports plus VGA, S-Video (for old laptop) and usual composite / Red-White-Yellow stuff (haven&#39;t used it yet). The stand feels a little flimsy (especially when I am turning TV); and the picture is different from 1080p sets - but for the price, it&#39;s a great TV	3.0	9/13/2012

Way out here in the western Pacific, products shipped from the US mainland can take weeks to arrive. This TV came in a week! I highly recommend it.

I&#39;ve never had a Sceptre monitor fail and I&#39;d expect this HDTV to give the same performance. The images on this LCD HDTV surpassed anything I&#39;ve seen and the value was phenomenal. Even at full price there is not another HDTV brand I would ever purchase. To say the least, I am very satisfied with my purchase. It&#39;s light and easy to move on it&#39;s swivel stand. The viewing angle is wide and it&#39;s colors are vibrant. Installation only took an instant.

I got it home, opened it, took the base out it had light scratches on it. I was mad. Then I took the tv out, the screen protecter had scratches and a big cut, 1st thing I thought was the screen was gonna be damaged, I took protecter off suprised it was thick. Screen was fine not a even a tiny scratch, took 3 mins to put screws into base, found out it was a swival base. I was happy. I been wanting a tv with a swival base. Got the cable box n wii hooked up, played with picture settings and looks amazing. I do run my cable with a hdmi cord, (but no hd channels) the sound is so so I can hear it so I can&#39;t complain not cinima quality.

I like the turntable base,too!	4.0	7/15/2011
walmart.com	Sceptre&#39;s are great quality TV&#39;s for their price. I bought my first 32&#34; @ 5 years ago and it is still going strong. Picture and sound quality have not diminished and I am still happy with the purchase.	4.0	7/22/2011

walmart.com	At first I was skeptical about buying a brand that I wasn&#39;t familiar with. But considering that it was only $179 for a 32&#34; I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised at all the features included in this TV - some of which I won&#39;t ever use, like the HDMI and the USB flash drive, but I especially liked the closed caption options and sleep timer features.	1.0	12/7/2011
walmart.com	Purchased this tv for a spare room sight unseen and so far have been very pleased. 1) This TV was shipped in 2 days from CO. to AZ. for the total shipping cost of $2.97 which made my full order including tax $198.44. 2) The shipping was via FedEx and provided tracking and delivery confirmation 3) All descriptions and specs were completely accurate. 4) TV was easy to unpack, add the base, and plug in to start using. 4) Picture and Sound for an extra room were great (this would not be my primary TV, but to each his own) so this fit exactly what I was looking for. 5) I am usually the last person to give a perfect rating, but in this case I have to, I would suggest this TV to anyone.	5.0	12/13/2011

Picture is great, sound (after adjusting the equalizer) is very good &amp; setup was as simple as scanning for channels.

walmart.com	I was concerned that this was not the 1020, so thought the picture might not be as clear as I&#39;d like. I had purchased another tv from another retailer that I returned because I couldn&#39;t hook it up to my older model vcr, got few air channels with my antenna and had a few other complaints. I was unsure of that decision but very happy now that I have purchased this one. I hooked up my VCR and didn&#39;t even have to purchase special cables. Also purchased an inexpensive hdmi cable (about $5) and can now watch movies from my laptop! An inexpensive antennae was hooked up (about $10) and I am getting many air channels. Sound and picture are great and I really like the swivel base that the other TV didn&#39;t have. All I want to add now is a bluray wi fi dvd player to play my dvds and watch netflix movies! Very pleased with this purchase and it is much better than the more expensive TV I returned because I just wasn&#39;t ahppy with it. I purchased the antenna, hdmi cable, and can purchase a highly rated bluray player for the same price of the TV I returned. Excellent value so far! Features got a 4 star because when I request info, I don&#39;t get the program name. Does everything else!	Toggle Search	5/3/2012

walmart.com	I ordered this item online for $149, though I&#39;d never heard of the brand. It was the cheapest 32&#34; TV I could find after Black Friday. (By the way, I also purchased a Hisense 32&#34; TV in-store at Walmart, about 10 days later, for the same price. Had never heard of that brand, either.) It was delivered free to the store nearest my house within a day or two of ordering. Very quick. It was simple to add the plastic base onto the bottom. Took about 20 minutes to read the instructions and finish it. It has a beautiful picture. I connected my Roku (for Netflix and Amazon Prime), a DVD player, and a digital antenna for local TV. I&#39;ve been using it for about 10 days, and all are working perfectly. The TV is replacing a 32&#34; LG that I bought more than five years ago (I recently gave it to my son). 32&#34; TVs have gone down in price nearly 70 percent since 2009. I paid $400 for the LG at Walmart in October 2009, and these were both $150 in December 2014. Also, the LG is an LCD screen, and these are both LEDs, 720p. Good buy, well worth the money. Get yourself one. Because you deserve it.	Invalid city, state or zip code	11/23/2012

I did not want to spend a lot of money for a tv that is rarely used, but now that I have had it in operation, I may buy another one for our bedroom in our primary home. There have been no issues. Good sound, picture, and a remote that is very easy to navigate. Not a lot of frills, but I got to tell you the simple nature of this tv is refreshing. This tv is a great value and I am very happy with it. Feel the need to spend a couple hundred more on a name brand, go ahead and waste your money.	5.0	9/19/2013

walmart.com	I am 14 years old and I know what you all are thinking...&#34;Why should I listen to him&#34;. But I do a lot of research into things. I was looking for a new TV that I could buy with my Christmas money. So I looked through a lot of sites such as Amazon, Walmart, Google shopping, ect... So I found this on sale for 209. I was fairly excited because I was upgrading from a 19 inch Sanyo HDTV to a 32inch Sceptre. So I got my money together and got my dad he said it looked like a good deal but we should more because we&#39;ve never heard of Sceptre. So i did more research and found it was worth the buy. So we couldn&#39;t find any other TV to match the price and size. So i bought the HDTV it was a great buy for that low of a price, Great shipping it said anytime from 12\29-1\4 and i ordered it on the 27th and got it on the 29th! This is a great buy but from my view the sound wasn&#39;t even all that good but it&#39;s decent something i can work with and everything else is pretty good! But if you have extra money I would suggest if you get it a 2 year warranty with it, Or a Sanyo, LG, Sony in the same size. Hope this helps!	5.0	1/9/2014

The sound quality is not great -- but we hooked it up to an old stereo on Auxiliary, and the sound is terrific. We have had no major problems with this TV at all -- very rarely I (like once a month or less) the sound cuts off suddenly. All it takes is turning it on and off to restore it. It&#39;s so infrequent that it&#39;s not an issue, especially considering the price. I recommend this TV to anyone with a small TV budget... but do hook it up to better speakers.	Walmart. Save Money.

walmart.com	This TV seems to compare favorably with the other brands in the size and somewhat higher price range. I&#39;m not altogether pleased with the sound quality and there&#39;s no tone control. This is helped by connecting powered speakers with controls. I did find the stand wobbly, as others have noted, but putting desktop size speakers under each side helped to stabilize the screen. The picture quality at 720p seems impressive for its size, though with LED, some of the warmth from CRTs seems to be lacking. One gets used it, hopefully, and after a week, I don&#39;t notice it so much. There are controls for brightening and changing the temperature which I&#39;ll try. The picture when watching DVDs has problems to some extent. There&#39;s fringing sometimes around the image edges, and some images within the picture tend to blur together in a not very prerry mass...like a video game without enough RAM, I think. One of the reasons we got this thing was to watch the vast collection of YouTube videos when we connect our iPad mini to the set via a VGA cable. We could also have the HDMI cable, but it costs more. Someone said the definition is better with that, but I&#39;m more than satisfied, and the VGA lets me connect the &#39;pad to the projector if I need a really large presentation.	5.0	11/26/2014

walmart.com	Factoring in the price, this is an average TV. Picture quality is acceptable, but audio at higher volumes breaks up (very cheap speakers used in this set).

walmart.com	Okay for a small room, or if you have speakers already. The built-in speakers are cheap and tinny sounding. The bass rattles. Cannot turn the volume up too far.

walmart.com	I have a lot of issues with this t.v. Bought it for under $200 and it is not under priced (32 inch). Picture is just OK and sound is hollow.

There is a delay when using and pushing the remote control buttons and I have to push several times to get it to change to whatever.

walmart.com	Had the same size and price unit with a different name brand. Both had same problem. Brightness of screen drops sometimes (flicker). Major difference between these two almost similar units (might come from same production line) however is the audio. Spectre&#39;s audio has no body, it is like listening through a tube. Adjusting the audio has not effect. Specifically it is like power a speaker without the benefit of an enclosure. Otherwise, you get what you paid for, which in my case, fits.	4.0	6/23/2011

walmart.com	Backlight went out after almost 3 months. TV got Medium to Heavy use. Taking back to Wal-Mart. Other than that this was a average unit, on par with its price. The stand was scatched when we opened the package and the box itself looked as if UPS/FEDEX was just tossing it around.	Items in cart	12/24/2011
walmart.com	I purchased this HDTV in June of 2012 for use in the bedroom. As a result it sees limited use compared with the primary TV in the family room. The picture quality was good for the sale price of $189 but it&#39;s not even close to the Sony Bravia 32&#34; in our lounge. The image is not as bright, vivid or crisp as the Sony, but for less than have the price, the image was very good in it&#39;s use as a secondary TV. The sound quality was average with no real bass and no real ability to handle movie sounds or music with great success. But it does work well in it&#39;s role as a bedroom unit playing primarily standard television programing. Unfortunately after only 10 months of service our unit has failed. During a recent power up the image shut off and only the sound remains. A strong odor of burnt electronics accompanied the failure. Sceptre requires that I ship the unit to them for warranty service and in either the original packaging (now gone) or request an approved package. I am required to pay shipping in either case. At a minimum this will be time consuming and cost between 10% and 15% of the original purchase price. Consider these potential future costs when opting for this price point model.

walmart.com	TV was very cheaply made. The speakers were very tinny and rattled whenever there was any bass on the show. Then it started to turn off all by itself. So I returned it at exchanged it for a Sony 32 inch which is a fabulous set.	Invalid city, state or zip code	12/31/2011
walmart.com	When I first got it, it worked great. The picture and sound are great and the features are good as well. After having it for only two weeks, it went out. All I got was a blue screen that said no signal. I spent three weeks sending emails to tech support trying to get it fixed. They&#39;re only open until 5:30pm pacific time, so if you work for a living you&#39;re not going to get in touch with them easily. Finally, got it fixed, it turned out to be something simple. A month later, guess what, it did the same thing again. Everything that they told me to try last time, I have already tried and nothing is working. This TV is not worth your money. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to family or friends or even somebody that I don&#39;t know. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to someone that I don&#39;t like. Nobody deserves this headache. Do yourself a favor and get something better.	4.0	1/20/2012

walmart.com	When I first received my tv, I was thrilled. The picture was great, the sound was great, I even bought a wall mount for it. I had no problems at all with this tv for 2 months, and then the picture went out on it. The &#39;Sceptre&#39; splash screen would come on when you first powered up the tv, but then the whole screen would just go black and you couldn&#39;t access any of the menus, change the channel- nothing. I would not recommend this tv to anyone unless you don&#39;t have a problem replacing the whole tv every 2 months because customer support is useless. Do Not Buy This TV!!!!	2.0	12/4/2012

walmart.com	Not really a fair review because there was a thin red line running across the screen on all channels. I was unable to fix it so I returned the set to Walmart 2 days after I bought it. They gave me a no hassle return of my money - and I went to the back of the store and bought a Magnovox 32 inch TV. It was $40 more than the Sceptre but so far is runnibg great.	1.0	11/21/2013
walmart.com	The TV set itself was great - wonderful picture, sound, easy to set up. However, the remote control stopped working one day after the purchase. I bought an RCA universal remote control, programmed it and worked for one day. Then I bought another universal control which was supposed to support the Sceptre brand but it would not work. I called the Sceptre 800 number. They were very helpful and mailed me another remote control but it did not work. I finally returned the TV and ordered a well known brand. I&#39;m not sure if I was just unlucky to get a TV that had a glitch.	1.0	11/24/2013

Returned the TV and paid to get the in-laws a Samsung TV and have not looked at Sceptre again. My wife called customer service when the TV died and customer service at Sceptre was rude and treated my wife like she was an idiot and said he could do nothing for her.

walmart.com	This turned out to be a nice little TV. It&#39;s bigger than I had anticipated. I didn&#39;t realize how big a 32&#34; TV would be! Set up was simple, and it&#39;s really easy to operate. It DOES come with a remote! I only had two problems. First of all, since it is a flat-screen TV, it doesn&#39;t do well in small rooms. Unless you are at least 4 - 5 feet from the screen, it&#39;s a little fuzzy. Once I moved it to another room where there&#39;s a lot more distance between me and the TV, the picture was great. My biggest problem with this TV is the sound quality. Our old &#34;tube&#34; TV with stereo speakers built in had way better sound quality. This TV sounds like it only has one speaker. Luckily, I had a set of Logitech speakers with a woofer that I connected and now it sounds great and looks great.	1.0	8/23/2012

walmart.com	Bought this, set it up and right out the box the sound quality drove me crazy. It sounded like I had bought something out of the toy section instead of the electronic section. Tv pics/quality changed from channel to channel, quite iritating. Picture took too long to come in once you pushed the button to change channels. The only thing I liked was the convenient swivel base. Save your money and invest in a more competitive brand. You get what you pay for and that&#39;s why I took it back about three days later.	4.0	10/11/2012

walmart.com	I bought mine a little over a year ago and a gray patch developed, then it took longer and longer to turn on. Apparently, upon researching this, this is a very common problem with this tv. While the price is appealing, it doesn&#39;t last long, and I ended up buying a better, 32 inch Sony for my bedroom, and Iike that the bezel(frame) on my new one is only about a 1/2 inch. You might have better luck then I did, but if I knew then what I know now, I would not buy this tv.	5.0	11/27/2012

The low price is not indicative of low quality. Picture is great and does very well with a home theatre surround sound set up. It is easy to use for online movies, for Playstation 3 DVD &amp; Gaming use. I ordered and got it right away, set it up, plugged stuff in, and was off and enjoying!!!

I&#39;ve had it a month now and couldn&#39;t be more enthusiastic about this set. Great clear picture, good sound, and I can see the baseball stats on the screen without squinting. It swivels so easily so I can see it from all angles...the remote is easy. My only suggestion for improvement would be that the sleep timer font size on the screen should be larger...I had to learn to touch the timer a certain number of times since I couldn;t see it unless I was just a few feet away. Given all the pros, it&#39;s easy to put up with only 1 con.	5.0	3/26/2013

I liked the original remote because it was simple and very easy to use.	5.0	4/10/2013
walmart.com	We purchased this TV to put outside on our screened-in porch. This TV is a great value for the price, with outstanding picture quality. At this low price, we figure if it lasts a couple of years, we got our money&#39;s worth---compared to the thousands it would have cost for an outdoor-rated TV.	Menu	4/27/2013
walmart.com	fully met my expectations, provided an audio output so I could send the signal via fm transmitter to my hearing aids. Not many units in this price range provide this feature. Sound control in going between different channels and/or loud commercials can only be described as weak. but for the price I would buy another unit. Only had for a short while so time will tell on reliability. Response time with email questions and telephone calls were within reason ( had to leave a message and receive a call back) and questions answered well. Could not get to real live person tho, only via call back. Gave it a five star because we can adjust to sound issue.	Toggle Search	5/10/2013

walmart.com	I ordered this TV on a Tuesday afternoon. Walmart said that it would be delivered between that Thursday or following Monday (with Expedited Shipping). It arrived Thursday morning. I was thrilled! I set it up Thursday night. The setup was extremely easy. The instructions were easy to follow and I love that a small screwdriver was included in the box (along with batteries for the remote control). Once it was setup, I started playing with the settings. There are several Aspect ratios to choose from: Normal, Cinema and Wide. There are several color &#34;tones&#34; to choose from &#34;Normal, Warm, Cool.&#34; You don&#39;t have to change any of these if you don&#39;t want to, I just like to fully check things out and see what they can do. The picture quality is really good, as is the sound. I do have to say that this is the first TV I&#39;ve ever purchased for myself. Every TV I&#39;ve had previously were hand-me-downs. I spent about 2 months researching my options before choosing this TV. I knew I wanted a 32&#34; flat-panel screen with 720p, among other things. This TV met all my requirements and was cheaper than what I could find at Sears, Best Buy, Walmart (in Store), or even Amazon. I was shocked! I have always been able to find whatever I needed cheaper at Amazon but not this time. As I stated earlier. I am very happy with my purchase.	5.0	3/30/2012

(I cannot remember what bells this TV has as we will probably never do more than watch TV on it.) This is a great 32&#34; flat screen TV for the money which is why I gave it an excellent rating. Less bass in the sound is important to us and we were able to adjust the sound easily. The first week we were a little disappointed in the picture quality as it was not very sharp.

walmart.com	I recently purchased this Sceptre 32 inch tv and within 4 days it was delivered to my door with free shipping. The initial setup was easy and within a few minutes a had scanned the cable for channels and the tv was operational. The tv has options to set the color, tint, and sound to your individual taste as well as many other options and after making a few minor changes I was well pleased with the picture quality. The picture is as good if not better than my $550 42 inch HD tv and at less than half the price. This tv is in our bedroom and since it is in the corner of the room the swivel base is a handy feature. As far as durability goes I have no idea as to that aspect but I would recommend the Sceptre based on picture quality and price.	5.0	11/12/2014
walmart.com	Very Good Panel with great color,sharpness and viewing angle. Looks fantastic running 1080. Th sound from the stock speakers is not all that good but when hooked to any other speakers is excellent. Plenty of jacks for home theater,hdmi,etc. This tv even plays MP3 music and JPEG photos from a flashdrive. I bought this as a Christmas gift so I tried it out first to make sure it was ok and I decided to keep it and I ordered another Sceptre 32&#34; as the gift. I would say for the price this tv may be the best deal on the market. I am very impressed with it and did buy two.	5.0	12/12/2014

I use a Roku streaming video player or a DVD player for viewing movies. With this ez set up, I have something interesting to view at any time at a very reasonable price.

I read everyone else&#39;s reviews prior to purchasing, and they were pretty spot on, it&#39;s a great tv! Our living room is on the cozier side and the 32&#34; size was absolutely perfect for it. If you are looking for a good tv, and not looking to spend a fortune, while the name is less known, this is a great one! The sound was a little off after initial set up, but we believe that&#39;s because of where we had it set up with the sound bouncing off of our wall. With readjusting our placement the sound issue was cured!	5.0	7/16/2011

walmart.com	I purchased the Sceptre 32&#34; HDTV a few days ago online, and received it a few hours ago. I paid less for this than I did for my last 28&#34; 4:3 HDTV just about three years ago. When that one gave up the ghost, I chose this one based on the number of five and four star ratings other owners gave it. In my case at least their advice is appreciated. There are better TVs on the market, with more features, but I&#39;d be hard pressed to justify a more expensive TV. Yes, this is just 720 lines of resolution instead of 1080, but I think unless you were looking at the TV with a microscope few would be able to tell the difference. Sitting across the room watching a program on a 32&#34; TV you would need eyes like an eagle to see a difference. In fact the Sceptre has a few features than nothing else even close to its price can claim. The only less expensive HDTVs were all smaller than 32&#34; and none as far as I saw had more than one HDMI port. The Scepter 32&#34; has three. A few around its price might have a USB port, but of those that do, that usually was only for firmware upgrades. The Scepter&#39;s USB port can be used for firmware upgrades, but it also enables the TV to play MP3 files, and show jpeg photos. The TV also boasts 1/8&#34; stereo phone plug for headphones, RCA phono plugs for A/V devices (like the Wii), a VGA connector to allow it to be used as a computer monitor, audio out RCA phono plugs for use with stereo equipment (like a home entertainment system), and RCA phono plugs for YPbPr (used by some systems to send separated color channel information for video). Setting up the Sceptre was a snap. It weighs only about 15 pounds, so it is easy to lift and move around. I had to attach the base with four Philips head screws which were provided. The package included a little Philips head screwdriver for that! Then I connected the monitor to my cable box with an HDMI cord, which I had to purchase extra. And finally I plugged the detachable power cord into the TV and the wall, and I was ready to go. The onscreen menu makes it easy to configure. I won&#39;t use my TV&#39;s tuner, but that&#39;s easy to set up as well. You would need to attach a cable or antenna, and then allow the TV to find channels the first time you start it up. In my case I only needed to select HDMI as the source for my A/V, set the clock, and find a suitable aspect ratio for the programs that I watch. All of that is easily done using the TV&#39;s remote. My DVR remote was easy to reprogram for the TV by selecting the first Sony HDTV number listed by my DVR. I&#39;ve never had HDTV without a cable connection, so I cannot say how it would be on an antenna. I know that you need a strong signal from your TV stations to drive the HD circuitry, so if you are out in the country without cable or Dish TV, this might not be the TV for you. Most, however, will be pleased with this TV if they are looking for a new TV that won&#39;t break the bank.	5.0	8/22/2011
walmart.com	After a great amount of research I chose this product because of price, features, size and the incredible WALMART.COM performance and reputation. I have never had a bad experience with them. For all those commentators who want to act like expert technophobes and criticize every little thing... let me say that this product is exceptionally good with a tremendous price point and it is absolutely the best purchase experience I have ever had with WALMART. Out of the box and fully programmed and hooked up to my stereo, Roku, DVD and very small interior antenna in less than 15 minutes. Description and specifications are dead-on! Yes, the speakers are bit weeney but since I don&#39;t use them it was not an issue. The picture quality is wonderful and I have zero problems picking up 23 channels which are about 12-15 miles away. Features and functions are abundant. Ordered, received and installed in 4 days using free store pick-up. This is the best purchase with 100% satisfaction I have made in years. I only wish I had room for a 2nd one!	5.0	8/22/2011

walmart.com	Expected to find something to be unhappy about considering the low price, but was surprised by the quality. Sure, not a feature rich high end big name model, but the picture, sound and remote are very adequate. It uses the Sony codes for the remote but does that mean it shares the technology or components, I don&#39;t know? I have 3 other flat screens from name brand companies and this compares well, especially the speakers. You can never expect a home theater sound quality from such a limited space and in this case a small price. The base is a little light weight, so be careful it will not be in an area where it can get bumped.	5.0	9/7/2011
walmart.com	I purchased this television on sale for a guest bedroom in our home -- it was an excellent purchase!! The set has a wonderful picture and great sound!!! It came with a small stand, remote control and av cables for DVD player hook-up. I also purchased the 3-year service contract. The set is light weight, very thin and perfect for almost anywhere in our house. Also, small enough and light weight enough to take on our road trips. Our son is currently staying with us and has been watching the set daily for the last month and has enjoyed it problem-free. I would highly recommend this set to anyone.	5.0	9/26/2011

The sound is better than we thought based on reveiws. Bottom line, if you want to use this for a home theater, you will need to make sure you have a digital signal and a good stereo. If that does not matter to you, this TV is great option.	5.0	10/7/2011

walmart.com	This television was purchased because of it&#39;s low price and LED feature. The picture quality is far superior to our other LCD televisions as well as our plasma television.

walmart.com	To tell the truth, I was little nervous to buy a no name brand LCD TV. But the price was so great, I went ahead. Surprisingly, the whole box was much lighter than my expectations when I picked it up from Walmart store. I bought it as a replacement to my basement TV. I connected a small antenna and was able to get about 15 local channels and the picture was surprisingly very crisp. Within no time, I hooked my WI and DVD player with it. It has several HDMI ports which provide the clearest picture. For my WI I bought a special cable with 5 wires on ebay for 3.99$. That made the WI games much sharper. I even connected my extra PC computer to the TV and was able to use it as monitor as well. Though, I also managed to get internet channel through my WI as well. The only pros is the remote control which acts little moody at times. But so far I am very happy with the purchase.	Items in cart	11/19/2011
walmart.com	This 32&#34; flat screen was purchased as a surprise gift for an elderly lady (89 yrs. old). She still had a 25&#34; set that was probably 20 years old. The picture quality is like night and day since her eyesight is failing as well. She wept when she received this gift and she absolutely loves her new tv!!!!! It was an exceptional value for the $$. Her television viewing is pretty much her whole life as she does not drive anymore. I know one lady who is very happy with this purchase. I would recommend this flat screen very highly. A lot of bang for the buck!	Enter city, state or zip code	11/21/2011
walmart.com	I bought this T.V. to replace the very old (and boring) analog 19&#34; Sony CRT Television in my family room. Even though my expectations were not very high to begin with, because it doesn&#39;t take much to beat a 19&#34; analog CRT TV, I was still pleasantly surprised by the features offered by this inexpensive TV. It has numerous inputs and even offers left and right audio outputs. The picture quality is sharp and clear. I probably could have spent a lot more money and gotten something that was name brand (and may or may not have had a few more features) but I personally am more than pleased with this purchase. It is a shame they don&#39;t carry this item &#34;in store&#34; but &#34;sight to store&#34; only took two or three days so I can&#39;t complain. Overall I would say that if you are looking for a 32&#34; LCD T.V., with a number of very good features, for a price that is more than fair, you need not look any farther.

walmart.com	This is a great tv! I&#39;m a Directv technician and I&#39;m in contact with about 12 different tv&#39;s on any given day. I feel that qualifies me as an expert of sorts ;) But honestly, I have seen many 32 inch sets from sony to samsung, even the cheapies like vizio and apex. The picture on this set is great in comparison to any of these. Samsung being the best in my opinon, but this is a close second. The sound isnt great which you should expect with any flat panel television. There really is no where to impliment great sound on sets this thin. A cheap surrond sound system should do. On a side note, I did hook this up to a Directv HD receiver. So if you have basic service dont expect to see the TV&#39;s true potential.	5.0	12/8/2011

walmart.com	I did so much &#39;reviewing&#39; before ordering this TV. I am not the kind of person who is technilogically smart....so I read tons of reviews. End result was that I ordered the TV because the price was one of the best I&#39;ve seen. Now that I have it...(2 weeks) I am sooo thrilled with it. I went thru the book, thru the OSD&#39;s and can&#39;t believe that I was able to work thru the whole thing. The sound is better than my 32&#34; LG and the picture is great...except that I still have to get a tiny bit more of the OSD lined up. I just love this TV and if I find another one with a great price I am going to get that one too for my spare bedroom. (guests will be absolutely thrilled!!)	4.0	1/23/2012
walmart.com	I bought this TV as a Mothers Day gift for my mom online and then had it shipped to the store for free. She loves the TV. It took a few minutes to hook it up to the cable and DVD player she currently has. It has a great picture and really good sound. You can hear the TV even when it&#39;s on volume 14 in the next room quite clearly. I think it&#39;s a great TV for the price I paid online. Even though, I had never heard of Sceptre before buying this TV. I will definitely check them out to see if they make anything else.	4.0	1/23/2012

walmart.com	My husband and I purchased this TV for our daughters bedroom, and the picture is great, the sound is a little rubbley, if you blast it, but I just adjusted the sound and lowered the Bass, and it&#39;s perfff! I would recommend this TV for a bedroom, or if you are replacing a boob-tube in the kids room like I was then you can&#39;t go wrong with a price like this!	4.0	1/24/2012
walmart.com	This is my first flatscreen TV, but it seems to be excellent, especially considering the $189 price including free shipping to my home. Ordered it on the 4th of July and it arrived on Saturday the 7th, can&#39;t do much better than that! Took a little fiddling to get the picture adjusted to my liking. The sound adjustment was one of a couple of different choices and sounds as good as any TV without additional speakers. I had to buy an HDMI cable to connect my blu-ray, you&#39;d think they would come with an HDMI cable since there is no other way to use the device, but it&#39;s not a big deal. I would recommend this TV to anyone and am considering a larger Sceptre for the livingroom. I read on someone&#39;s review that these are made at the same plant that makes the much higher priced Sony models. The quality on this set seems to be very good, so that may be the reason.

walmart.com	my overall review with this product was exceptional. the price was great, the tv itself is an amazing product, very simple to program, very simple to operate, everything was included, batteries, remote,directions. it even came with a screwdriver.. i was very impressed. one of the better electronic purchases i&#39;ve made in a long time....you won&#39;t be dissapointed if you purchase this product..	Toggle Search	1/27/2012
walmart.com	I was apprehensive about purchasing a brand name I was not familiar with. This TV blew me away since it is $100 less expensive than the same size and specs as my Vizio that I also love. I was a bit concerned about being able to program my Direct TV remote to the TV, but Direct does have a code for it. As it turns out, the remote worked perfectly without reprogramming it. The remote was previously programmed to a Sony and I didn&#39;t have to change anything. Easy set up and I love the swivel base. I have 2 Sylvania sets of the same size and neither one of them have ever been able to program to the Direct TV or the Dish Network remote.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/31/2012
walmart.com	I bought this TV, even after reading some of the terrible reviews here, and am not disappointed so far. I&#39;ve known of Sceptre from years of computer use and know that their monitors are great quality, so figured that they probably did a good job transitioning to TV&#39;s as well. Of course for under $200 I didn&#39;t expect to get high def picture quality or Dolby sound, but wasn&#39;t looking for that. I just wanted a larger TV for my living room. The picture quality actually is pretty good, with vivid and accurate color although a bit pixilated if you get up real close, and the set up is a breeze. Sound does leave a bit to be desired though, so for those who enjoy the full, rich sound of the theater, I would recommend an add-on sound system. I also enjoyed the fact that this set is VERY light, making it easy to place where ever you want it. I also like the remote that comes with this set! Very easy to understand and use, unlike the one that came with my last TV. I also wanted to comment about some of the reviews here that stated that customer service was impossible (or nearly) to reach on the phone. I decided to call the customer service number listed in the online documentation prior to receiving my TV to ask a few questions relating to other posts I had read here. I was pleasantly surprised when a very polite, friendly and professional customer service rep answered the phone on the first ring and proceeded to answer all of my questions quickly, thoroughly and professionally. Guess this just goes to show that you can&#39;t believe everything that you read. :-) Glad I took the chance and ordered this TV. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a mid-sized TV without spending a lot of money. Good product!	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/31/2012

The one issue I do have is that there&#39;s only one set of &#34;red, white, and yellow&#34; plug holes. In turn I have to get an HDMI cable to have my TV working with my DVD player and PS2 at the same time. Other than that, it&#39;s wonderful!	Enter city, state or zip code	3/17/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this tv a year ago. It runs on most days over 10 hours. We have had no issues with picture or sound.

walmart.com	I finally got around to upgrading from my old CRT TV with this set and I couldn&#39;t be more satisfied. Being used to the old standard definition set it is hard for me to judge for sure just how much of the picture quality improvement is due to now having HD but I can say the picture quality is excellent, colors are crisp and true and the overall quality is great. While the sound quality is very good I do plan to add either a sound bar or external surround sound system in the future, it is really not a matter of necessity but with the great picture I want the full effect of a matching sound system. I don&#39;t think you can beat the value of this TV, I am on a limited budget and found it very affordable.	1.0	11/14/2012
walmart.com	Sceptre is the best flat screen TV I have ever purchased. Normally I purchase Visio but from now on my flat screens will be Sceptre&#39;s! Flat screens are not known for their reliability but I have insurance through my cable TV operator that replaces failed equipment at no cost. I have had one of my Visio&#39;s fail. I&#39;ll have to wait on the Sceptre to prove itself. However, my guess is it will last a long time.	1.0	11/20/2012

walmart.com	Before buying this TV online I read most of the reviews. Some were positive, some not so much. But I have to say I am very, very pleased with my TV. It is exactly as described in the details. Some were complaining about the sound and I was expecting to have to buy a speaker system for it. I have no problem with the sound.The price is great and so far, so good with everything else. I&#39;ve had it for about 4 or 5 weeks now and it has played almost 24-7and I can&#39;t complain about anything at this point, and Lord I hope it stays that way.	1.0	11/21/2012

walmart.com	This is my impression of the Sceptre X322BV 32&#34; 720 led LCD. I can&#39;t see anything bad about this TV. The broadcast reception is excellent, the picture is excellent - good color/ contrast right out of the box!, the USB slideshow is excellent. If you just watch, not live for TV, then this is a fine product. It&#39;s only 720p, but broadcasters in my area don&#39;t sent out more than 1080i, so not a problem. The viewing angle is nearly equal to my samsung plasma. I like the picture/ color temp/ tons more than my Viore led LCD 1080 TV (always trying to tweak it). Only had this a few weeks, but so far it is amazing. The speakers are average for this type of TV - but with analog &#34;RCA&#34; jacks, a 3.5mm jack, &amp; 3 HDMI ports you can plug into just about anything. Can not play video files thru USB - like my samsung - but I knew that before purchase. I seem to recall reading that there are only 2 or 3 actual manufacturers of LCD screens and everybody slaps their guts into the same screens. I can not rate features because I don&#39;t &#34;live&#34; for TV - or gaming, so I may not be familiar with all, or lack of, features.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	12/12/2012

When I hooked it up to my laptop to use as a 2nd screen, which works great, but when I watched a show with the hdmi cable the sound had to be turned up all the way and still was not loud enough. It is better when connected to the cable for tv. Overall, I am still very pleased with it for the value and cost.	1.0	5/13/2014

I tried my PC with this TV to a resolution of 2560 by 1080 at 75 HZ and got excellent results. This high of resolutions was not listed in the manual but it did work. If you have a computer connected to the TV, try the highest resolution and see what happens. Won&#39;t hurt.	1.0	5/20/2014

walmart.com	I wanted a tv for my bedroom that was large enough to see without my contacts but that wasn&#39;t too pricey as I would only be watching it right before bed. The reviews on this one was great so I went for it. The quality of the picture is much better than my daughter&#39;s 32&#34; RCA brand tv in her playroom. I spent almost double for it last year than I did on this one. She prefers to watch tv in my room as opposed to her playroom now.	5.0	5/21/2014
walmart.com	I may be rushing this review since I just set up this TV last night, but so far, I love it! It has a beautiful picture and the manual is very easy to understand as are the instructions for putting the TV on the stand. In fact, this TV comes with everything you need, including a magnetic screw driver, to put it together. I&#39;ve looked everywhere, including online stores that sell refurbished or even used TVs, and no one beats this price. I purchased it for a guest bedroom so I won&#39;t be watching it a lot, but even a smaller TV cost more elsewhere, so I bought the 32&#34;. I have always paid attention to the reviews and this TV got great reviews. Gotta love Walmart!	5.0	5/21/2014

This TV is even better since its been updated with a super slim brushed metal bezel. Great picture quality at 32&#34; though I would recommend 1080p for TV&#39;s larger than this. Consider purchasing the Sceptre Sound Bar to improve sound quality but really OK with standard speakers. Walmart had the best price online and I felt secure purchasing from them.

walmart.com	This is my second Sceptre television. I have yet to have any issues with either set. For the price you pay you get a set with excellent picture quality and all the connections you&#39;ll need to make a great entertainment system. The only knock against the set is the location of the speakers, back bottom, which makes it necessary to turn the volume a little higher than normal to hear it. All in all, a really good television at a very good price.	4.0	8/26/2014

walmart.com	installation was ridiculously easy, picture quality was great, although it didn&#39;t specify surround sound it would have been nice, great bargain	5.0	9/1/2014
walmart.com	For a 32&#34; TV and considering its price the set seems to perform well. At (only) 32&#34; it probably won&#39;t be your primary TV in a living room, so it&#39;s being evaluated mostly as a nice sized set in a bedroom. For a main entertainment set, you&#39;d probably want to look a few size classes up anyway. 40&#34; sets have come down so much in price anyway. The 720 vs 1080 distinction doesn&#39;t seem to make a substantial difference looking at this set from across the bedroom. The quality is good with an HD signal. If you&#39;re replacing a non-HD set with this one (as I did) expect to notice a bit of fuzziness with non-HD input. Any &#34;upscaling&#34; this unit may try to do doesn&#39;t seem to work as well as it does by our main television. The sound quality is quite poor, but that&#39;s a common gripe with flat screen sets. Regardless, it&#39;s noticeably worse than our other TVs. I mitigated this by hooking it up through the iPhone dock next to this TV. Still, at the price it was purchased, a decent sound bar could still be acquired and come out ahead on both money and quality. All things considered it&#39;s a good set, and a perfect size for a bedroom. Not too big as to be blinding at night, but big enough to see clearly across a room.	5.0	9/1/2014
walmart.com	We love this TV. It has a really good picture and the color is bright. I read some of the reviews before the purchase and most were right on the money. If, this is an additional television for your home (video games, computer, etc.) this will be a great buy. The sound quality is not good but, that is the only drawback with this purchase.	5.0	9/16/2014

The picture is a bit grainy of you are real close to the screen, but I have a large living room so picture quality is not a problem for me. Sound could be a bit better, but it is pretty decent as well. For the price, this is a very serviceable television set. I am quite pleased with the purchase.	5.0	10/1/2014
walmart.com	The only thing I don&#39;t like about this tv is the sound. We have hooked up our surround sound to it so it worked out fine for us but if you don&#39;t have that the sound quality is not the best. Good for a kids room.	5.0	10/7/2014

walmart.com	I helped my 11 year old son search for his first LCD TV and this Sceptre 32&#34; met his wants and needs. Overall this LCD is a great product. Picture quality was great right out of the box, no dead pixels, features easy to use, and at an excellent price. I gave the TV 4 stars because the stand could be more stable. It will sway if you force it, but if sitting stationary the stand holds the TV with no problems. The speakers are not the greatest, but are not bad and do the job. My son loves his new TV and loves playing Xbox360 on it. I am now thinking about purchasing a larger Sceptre for myself. All in all I would recommend this TV for anyone looking for a quality product on a budget.	5.0	10/20/2014

walmart.com	First off the important thing: The picture is great! When using an HDMI connection and an HD channel, it has a fantastic picture. For the less positive: The sound can get rattly when turned up. We use a sound system so don&#39;t notice that so much. I hooked HDMI up to the #2 connector on the back of the TV and had all kinds of trouble with pixillated channels and sound not staying with the picture. When I switched to the #1 HDMI, everything worked fine. So I don&#39;t know what the issue is with that port. This is an excellent value at $249.	5.0	11/1/2014

walmart.com	This TV is decent. The picture quality is ok, sound is a bit lacking, and the remote feels cheap. The reason I rate this TV high is that it is impossible to find a 32&#34; at this price. I wouldn&#39;t make this the main TV for a home theater, but for the bedroom or a dorm room, this TV is perfect. If it blows up in 2 years, i wouldn&#39;t cry too much. The picture quality shall not be compared to mid-level Samsung, LG, Sony, etc. As long as you are not used to seeing top quality HDTV, the picture will be ok. Sound has no depth or bass. It feels like listening to a cheap pair of computer speakers. HDMI input works fine with my Hannspree laptop, the screen resolution and refreshing rate is recognized immediately. The set looks good and is steady. I&#39;ve had it for a month with no problems...	5.0	11/9/2014

We checked the TV out at the store and the screen did not seem to be cracked. So far the TV is working okay, just have my fingers crossed that the uncaring truck driver did not ruin something internal. So I would rate this product good and Walmart&#39;s site to store drivers poor.	4.0	11/30/2014

walmart.com	Just like most other&#39;s reviews I would say the only flaw is the feedback you get from the speakers.

I actually first bought a Samsung and returned it for this one bc I wasn&#39;t impressed with the picture quality for the price I paid.

When we updated our programming to the hd package the screen quality was MUCH better. I remember reading about the sound quality being poor and it isn&#39;t exceptional, but it isn&#39;t awful either. It seems like the sound quality improves when we watch HD channels. Eventually we&#39;ll probably get a speaker system but it isn&#39;t really necessary if you aren&#39;t all that picky. Overall we&#39;re happy with the purchase.	5.0	1/2/2015

The sound quality is not as good and sounds tinny but is suitable for my bedroom. I don&#39;t expect sound quality on flat screens to be that great because of how the speakers have to be on flat screens. I had a similar issue with my 42in rca plasma and the sound. Overall, for the price, which was great, its a good fit for me!	5.0	1/3/2015

Only two real cons are first, the sound quality is a bit lacking - it&#39;s fine for my purposes (the occasional football game or sitcom), but if you&#39;re an audio buff you are definitely going to need a speaker set up. Second, the casing is a bit flimsy - it&#39;s very lightweight plastic, and doesn&#39;t feel real solid or stable. That being said it is still a good, cheap alternative if you want a large LCD screen without a large sticker price.	5.0	1/3/2015
walmart.com	I purchased this item for Christmas for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! she thanked me over and over again.	5.0	1/3/2015
walmart.com	This TV was an early Christmas gift from my parents to be placed in my bedroom. They told me to get online and find myself an affordable 32 inch TV. I found this one and was skeptical at first because I had never heard of the brand, but the price was awesome. I figured it was only going in the bedroom so an unfamiliar, greatly priced TV would be fine. It arrived way earlier than it was suppose to and we have been very satisfied with it. I LOVE the fact that it swivels on it&#39;s stand. It&#39;s very convenient for me when I&#39;m laying in bed watching it. I can just tilt it in my direction without having to move the stand. The picture quality is great. The sound quality is good but there&#39;s normally no in between with it. It always seems that it is either too loud or too low, haven&#39;t found the perfect sound setting yet.	5.0	1/4/2015

walmart.com	We purchased the tv for our bedroom. We purchased it due to the great price and wasn&#39;t so concerned about the picture or sound. It works great for what we use it for. But if I were going to used it in the living room, I would spend a little more and get better sound. The sound is pretty weak. I might go ahead and put 2 external speakers on it anyhow. The picture is better than I expected. Good tv for the price.	5.0	1/7/2015

walmart.com	I ordered this TV for my bedroom. The picture and color is great. I had a little trouble with the sound at first. Make sure you uncheck the surround sound box if you&#39;re not hooking up to a theater system.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/23/2015
walmart.com	We wanted an inexpensive flat-screen for our bedroom that had a sleep timer. This Sceptre 32&#34; fit the bill. It is hooked up to a SD satalite box but still gets a very good picure. Took some phone calls to Sceptre and Direct TV to get it hooked up but works fine now. Of course we have only had it hooked up for 5 days so have no idea how long it will operate but so far very happy.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	1/23/2015
walmart.com	If you&#39;re expecting to get an incredible TV for dirt cheap, you&#39;re going to be disappointed with this TV. But, if you understand that you get what you pay for, and all you really need is a decent TV for a good price, then you can&#39;t beat this one. The picture is great, and the TV looks very nice, plus plenty of hook-ups in back. Sound quality is lacking and sounds a little like a tin can. Also, the channels are kind of weird when it scans them for you (51-1, 51-2, 54-7, etc.) making it difficult to tell what channel you are on unless you have a cable box or take the time to name the channels in the TV setup which isn&#39;t very difficult. Clicker is a little on the cheap side too, but like I said - you get what you pay for. Great TV for the money!	Clear search field	1/23/2015
walmart.com	A little early to say how good this set is but it is, picture is very nice but not as perfect as some reviews said but definately good, sound is accecptable and clear, i think the only bad thing is how stupid the stand mount is, i bought a wall mount for only 8 bucks here on line and was a breeze to put up but you have to remove a stem on the bottom of the tv and keep for later use if you want it to look nice, overall so far a good buy	Search	1/24/2015
walmart.com	I have bought several Sceptre Televisions in the 32 inch to 42 inch size range. I find them more than acceptable and they seem to be much better in terms of picture quality than other no name brands I have tried like &#34;TCL&#34;. While they are not in the same league as my 60 inch Sharp LED, they do the job in small bedrooms or wherever you would like an extra TV and don&#39;t want to spend a lot of money. I would say Sceptre is on its way to making a name for itself in the TV market in the way Hyundai became an acceptable no joke brand in the car market.	Items in cart	1/28/2015

walmart.com	We ordered this t.v. for our daughter as a Christmas present, we didn&#39;t want to go way over the top due to her age and what it was going to be used for (mostly gaming). The picture is actually better than we hoped for very clear and great quality, and that is it only be used on 480i not the full 720. The sound however is not the greatest, sounds very muffled and mono not stereo. We hooked up speakers to it and now it is just fine.

walmart.com	I have been holding off on writing anything for a couple of weeks to see if any bugs that I had read about might develop. So far, so good. I would say this television is an incredible value. No, not top of the line and anybody that expects that needs to plan on paying at least $300 more. But, for the price, I am not disappointed at all. Positives, very easy set-up, good picture and I haven&#39;t even set up HD yet. Sound is better than what I expected. Anyone complaining about this aspect, no it isn&#39;t a Bose sound system, but once again, it is worth what paid for. Better than expected. Very user friendly as far as settings go. Also, surprised that it has a rotating stand...just an extra plus. Negatives, yes, case is cheaply built. But unless you have a child that attacks everything with something hard, it will hold up just fine. Remote, not the greatest in the world, but use my Comcast remote anyway, so no big deal. As stated, no, the sound is not ideal, but fine for listening at lower levels. Turn it up to much and that is when the inferior sound is noticed. Big deal, hook to surround sound, or as I do, just run through stereo system. At this point in time, I am glad I made this purchase. The Wal-Mart site to store delivery worked well. No problems. Would definitely recommend this to a friend. Will update in the future if something arises.	5.0	7/7/2015

walmart.com	Like many looking at the price tag on this, I was a little skeptical about it. I purchased the 2 year extended warranty, just in case. I don&#39;t know how long it will last. But, straight out of the box, I am quite impressed with this TV. Given the price, you really can&#39;t go wrong. I purchased this TV to go in our master bedroom, so I could mount it on the wall. It is very light. It has a good picture quality. The sound is a little blah, but we don&#39;t need too much out of it for a bedroom. I was told by my satellite installer that these are made by either Hitachi or Sony, but I have not been able to confirm. Overall, I&#39;m very happy with this purchase.	5.0	8/13/2015
walmart.com	I purchased this television as a gift for my boyfriend of 11 years. He&#39;s wanted a flat TV for years and I finally found one in a price range I could manage. I am very satisfied with this television. We don&#39;t have HD available at home, but it is still a very good television. The only improvement I would suggest to the manufacturer is additional input jacks for multiple devises such as a game console and a DVD player without having to switch out the jacks from one to the other.	5.0	8/18/2015
walmart.com	I was a little skeptical, considering I had never heard of the brand name before. But it was such a great deal, I had to go for it. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived.

Overall, I am glad I made the purchase.	5.0	8/19/2015

walmart.com	My 28 inch hi res viewsonic monitor recently died when the power company shot a voltage spike through the 110 line. I wanted something large to replace it and looked at products from many manufacturers. Walmart had the Scepter 32 inch HDTV for 209, plus service plan if wanted. I decided it was so inexpensive I would try it, and if it did not work out, then I would use it as an HDTV. Well - it works great as a monitor. My only complaint, and its not really a complaint, is that I would have liked a higher resolution. There are many HDTV&#39;s out there that have higher res, but they also costs at least 100 dollars more. The Scepter is easily readible, and comes with all sorts of bells and whistles such as built in speakers, and a headphone jack. It also has an input for USB, but I am not using it. It accepts HDTV input and has a VGA jack for input from my computer. It has its own stand, or it can be attached to a wall mount. I use the stand and have no complaints. I am quite sure it will stand up better than a traditional computer monitor, but just be be safe, I bought the 3 years maintenance plan. Total costs for everything, including store pickup, came to less than 275 dollars. My old monitor costs far more than that, so all in all, I think Walmart&#39;s deal is fantastic. I hesitate not a second to recommend this to anyone who is interested. Be aware though that its resolution is limited to 1300x768.	5.0	8/31/2015

walmart.com	I think it is an excellent TV for our room. The only real complaint I have is that the remote control is hard to use. You do have to make sure it is pointed at the blue light or it won&#39;t change the channel and then it may or may not work all the time. (we did put new batteries in it) The sound is OK but could use a little improvement, but it isn&#39;t a deal breaker. Over all a good TV for the price. We bought it site to store and the service was great. Will be making more purchases that way.	5.0	9/21/2015

The sound is good. I was a liitle worried at first about purchasing the TV because of the price, thinking the quality and picture might not be that good because it was so cheap, but now i am very happy.

I bought it when my RCA blew a couple boards. I needed external sound equipment to hear my programming well. I eventually fixed the RCA (which is bigger with great sound) so this one was retired to my bedroom where I rarely watch TV. One advantage to this TV over my old (besides durability) is being an LCD it has 0 interference with my IR technology devices (remote controls and wireless headphones), a problem seen with Plasma TV&#39;s.	5.0	12/7/2011

walmart.com	I read all the reviews, shopped around and did my homework before purchasing this tv. So, when it arrived I knew what to expect. Was worried about the sound based on reviews which for the most part were quite accurate. It did sound a bit tinny and I don&#39;t recommend turning it up too loud as it will vibrate. However my needs do not require that type of sound quality. I did adjust the bass to a much deeper level and so it&#39;s sound is acceptable too us. The picture is very nice and set-up was uncomplicated. It is on every day and we have had it for about 9 months and have not had a problem. I have just ordered another one. My extremely old bedroom tv (the bulky heavy kind we all used to have before these new generation flat televisions) is finally dead. I ordered an Emerson with dvd combo that was on sale at WM. It had good reviews, but boy did I ever learn something. I did not know that some flat tvs could only be watched from directly in front of them. Not 2 feet to one side or the other, or from sitting on the floor. This was not acceptable for me as I often have to lay flat on the floor to do exercise and therapy to relieve back problems - so it is going back, and after again shopping around and doing my homework, found that this Sceptre model that we purchased in January was again going to be the best bet for my money. I am hoping that I can report in another 9 months that the new one I just ordered keeps me as contented as I am so far with this one. I live about 100 miles from the nearest WM store, so I do most of my shopping online for just about everything but groceries, and I always get good service. If I am not happy with a product, WM is very good about accepting a return, which I HAVE had to do a number of times. Not WalMart&#39;s fault - usually just a manufacture problem, or in the case of my recent Emerson tv purchase, the fact that I am not well versed when it comes to the specs of a product. I think the sound is the only drawback with this Septre, but as I understand, that is an inherent trait to almost all flat screen tvs and can be remedied with exterior speakers or a soundbar. Keeping my fingers crossed that the new one is just as good as this one!! I&#39;ll let you know how it turns out.	5.0	12/20/2011

walmart.com	I did a lot of comparison shopping before I bought this TV. I don’t have cable or satellite so I wanted to be sure I could attach my antenna and that it would pick up the over the air signal, which it does(the antenna has HDTV scanning ability, so that might be a factor for you). I didn’t want LED, LCD (to me) has a sharper picture. So far so good, I’m very pleased with this TV.	5.0	12/25/2011

I decided to mount it and it looks even greater up on the wall. Great price and purchase for our bedroom entertainment.

We have a Samsung 1080P TV in our living room with wiFi, etc, so I was worried we would be disappointed with this TV, but for the price it was worth the gamble. If you are looking for a living room TV, definitely get a sound bar or surround sound system. However, for our bedroom it is perfect. Overall we are happy with the TV and the picture but we have only had it a week or so. Set-up was super easy and the TV is super light so I was able to do it all myself without fear of dropping it and ruining it.	5.0	8/26/2012

walmart.com	I am very happy with this tv. It was easy to set. The available ports for older equipment are nice to have. My satellite receiver is an older one that uses the RCA jacks and I was able to use it with this tv without issue. The only negative thing I have to say is that the sound is a little difficult to adjust but, I do not think that it is a problem with the tv. I have the tv in a cabinet with a large hole in the back. The hole was from a previous older tv that was extremely deep. Since the speakers on flat panel tvs tend to be on the sides or back of the unit the sound is not able to bounce off the back of the cabinet like it should. Picture is very good with the satellite signal. The size of the tv is nice. I like the thinner border around the outside edge.	5.0	10/26/2012

walmart.com	I know my review title and rating may seem at odds, but I got this for even less than what is advertised here, so it is a 4 out of 5 for the price I paid. Sadly, this is my main TV and it replaced an Emerson I had for 6 years which just needs capacitors. They are cheap, but of course the service would be as much as this new TV. This TV is so cheaply made compared to the one I had, I was scared it was going to fall over when I set it up. It has a swivel bottom which most people probably like, but I already have a TV swivel. All the connectors are underneath the TV. They couldn&#39;t have put them in the worst place. The only picture choices that will fit on the screen (for TV viewing) are normal and wide. I understand the other choices, for movie watching, but wide is the only setting where you can see people&#39;s heads and their WIDE bodies. The picture is very dark. I&#39;m going to call the company to see how to lighten the picture, even though I think I&#39;ve done all I can. Surprisingly, the sound was not as bad as other reviews. That I can stand. This is a good TV for a kid&#39;s room or basement. I would advise buying the warranty. I&#39;ve been very lucky with my TVs and if this TV lasts 4 years, I will be very surprised, so $24 is not that much to keep it for that long. After being so negative, as I said, for what it cost it is worth it and if it lasts 4 years, it is a deal. But if you are buying this as your only or main TV, I&#39;d look some more.	5.0	11/24/2012
walmart.com	I&#39;ve had this TV in the 40&#34; for over a year and I&#39;ve had no problems with it. I got the 32&#34; for my 97 year old father as a replacement for an old analog TV. He has been complaing about it since I set it up. To be fair he complains about everything I try to do for him. There are two issues with this TV that I&#39;d read about in other reviews before I bought mine. #1: The stand is cheap plastic and wobbly #2: The sound isn&#39;t high quality. I overlook these issues for myself because the price is affordable but this is what my father is complaining about. So I&#39;m buying a wall mount and speaker bars for his TV. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll complain about these too, but I will know I did my best. I think this is pretty decent TV for the price.	5.0	11/27/2012

They mostly watch cartoons and play video games on it, and I love the picture quality, the games (gamecube) almost looks 3D, so Iam very happy with the picture and size of the tv. The only problem I had is when I first plugged it in and programed it I did not like the sound of it, It sounded like a person who has a bad bass system in their car and all you can her is the plastic and metal rattling and after messing around with the bass and tremble controls it sounds much better. I also think if it had more options for plugging in games would be much better, cause they have to disconnect the one system and connect the other one. The boys are happy with their tv and that all that matters. Right?	5.0	3/4/2013

I took it back to my house and took my old TV out. I hooked up the satellite receiver and began flipping through the channels. Now first off, I don&#39;t have HD channels. Without them, the picture is just ok.. Nothing special. The volume had to be turned up really high to even hear it. A few minutes into watching it, the screen FLIPPED OUT. Like the black and white fuzz in 2 stripes going all the way across the screen and making a horrible scratching sound. But only for about 2 seconds. Then it went completely back to normal. If it only did it once and then was fine, I would&#39;ve kept the Tv. However, it would do this every couple of minutes; sometimes every couple of seconds. Extremely annoying. If it wouldn&#39;t do that, it would be a fair little Tv. But I cannot handle the screen tweaking out every other second. I couldn&#39;t find anything on other reviews about this problem so it&#39;s not like I could ask someone else how they fixed it. I returned the TV and got my money back.	5.0	5/1/2013

walmart.com	the sound system needs a 100% improvement, the remote control could use a better design , like the channels # on the bottom, the mute control on the middle, and a few more details that will improve the customer satisfaction with the product	5.0	5/12/2013
walmart.com	Nice looking, good features, good sound.......disappointed in the picture quality. I haven&#39;t tried to change the settings on the color yet, but the factory settings are set that the color of everything is very pale.	5.0	5/17/2013
walmart.com	I ordered and received this tv in good condition and before promised. It was easy to hook up. I was disappointed with the picture quality. Seemed to be grainy and words appeared somewhat blurry. I couldn&#39;t resist ordering at such an awesome price but ended up returning. Bottom line, it was a great deal for a fair to average tv.	5.0	5/23/2013

walmart.com	Although we were very glad to find a 32&#34; HDTV for around $200, the television is already defective. We turned it on this morning and 3/4 of the screen is blacked out. The remaining portions (1/8 on each side) are barely visible. The sound is fine, but the screen is obviously defective. We purchased it online and received it 4/4/2012. On 5/5/2012, it is defective. I am looking forward to seeing how I will be treated: 31 days old, 3 yr extended warranty.	5.0	8/18/2013
walmart.com	This TV is passable - not bad for the price but the sound isn&#39;t great. Worst part is the closed captioning ONLY works with TV or Video input. Not with HDMI or DVR - so no help when sound is less than crisp. Wish I&#39;d known that before I unpacked it and hooked it up. Been too long now ...	5.0	8/26/2013
walmart.com	This is an update to an earlier review. Sceptre did send a postage paid return shipping label. They received the TV 7/12/2012 and had a brand new one back on it&#39;s way 7/13/2012. I received it 7/18/2012. I was without a TV a total of nine days. I like the TV and just hope this one lasts. Both my Toshibas were still working when I replaced them. Had them more than 20 years. Wished I&#39;d kept one as a backup.	5.0	9/2/2013
walmart.com	Speakers are tinny sounding. When I go from tv source to av to play dvd recorder and then try to change source back to tv, I have to manually turn off tv and back on to change source. Is this a problem?	5.0	9/3/2013
walmart.com	I bought this tv and about 6 months later the picture went out (but I still had sound). It had been too long to take it back to walmart so I had to send it to Sceptre to have it repaired. I had to pay the shipping charges to have it sent to them and that was almost $40. I&#39;ve had it back for a few months now and the other night I went to watch a movie on it and it won&#39;t play the movie on my tv...somehow it isn&#39;t picking up the connection from my dvd player. Now for the last few days the closed captioning keeps coming on and I keep having to keep turning it off. Ugh.	Menu	9/3/2013
walmart.com	Good product in general. For some unknown reason however, this TV brand cannot identify some of the local digtital channels that are available in the area. Other than that, the TV is OK if it is not intended to be a product people want to set in the living room of their house.	Toggle Search	9/11/2013

Picture is okay and sound could be better but for the price it is a decent tv. If you don&#39;t watch tv often or aren&#39;t concerned with having top quality then I would recommend the tv. For the everyday gamer or avid tv watcher who wants crisp sound and amazing detail I would look elsewhere.	4.0	10/26/2013
walmart.com	It is difficult for me to rate this product as it was damaged shipping from site to store. The glass on the screen was destroyed. After much haggling and intervention on my part, this was a birthday gift for my daughter who lives 2.5 hours away, the TV was eventually replaced with a different model. So, again, we cannot rate this particular product. It did look awesome on the website and appeared to be the perfect product for my daughter&#39;s rather small apartment, which is why I gave an average rating.	4.0	11/11/2013

walmart.com	We bought this tv because it got decent reviews from others and seemed like a good value. We received this product promptly, set up was a breeze but when we turned the tv on it went to a start up screen and immediately went black. There was nothing my technology savey boyfriend and I could do to remedy the situation. Sceptre&#39;s customer service line has limited hours and when we did call during their business hours we got a voicemail. We also emailed in regards to this problem and got a fairly quick response (within 48 hours). The email said we could either fax them some paper work and whatnot or we could just return the tv to Walmart. We chose the easier of the two options and returned the tv to our local Walmart seamlessly. Because our Walmart does not carry this tv we would have had to order the tv online all over again. We ended up spending $50 more on a Sony and I feel much more confident with that purchase. It&#39;s hard for me to rate the tv as I was never able to actually use it. I didn&#39;t see any other reviews on the Walmart website about others having the same issue as i did so maybe it was just a fluke and we got the dud?	5.0	2/25/2014

walmart.com	After reading the reviews for this TV, decided to purchase for bedroom when price dropped to $209. Love the ship to store option. Brought the TV home, once installed, adjusted picture to the best of its ability by a professional but, not the best picture, even for the price and all the reviews offered. A bit disappointed but still hoping once I get the HD receiver installed, picture quality will improve. Overall, it&#39;s an OK TV for bedroom but, would not recommend for viewing in a family room where quality counts. Only way I would recommend this TV is for gaming or bedroom viewing only but be sure to install the HD receiver for a better quality picture...keeping my fingers crossed it will improve.

It took me about 30 minutes to get the energy star sticker off the front and it&#39;s still not even off all the way. What Walmart is doing is selling floor models from around the country. The remote/manual bag was already open as well. Picture Quality: is terrible compared to other LCDs that i&#39;ve owned. I tried hooking up my laptop to the RGB output and it gave me a headache the quality was so bad. About the only way to get decent quality to this TV is to run 720p+ to it.

Then it took two weeks for them to honor their warranty by having me to mail back my TV without any consideration for your loss of use of their product. Apparently it&#39;ll take 2-3 weeks to fix the TV and they don&#39;t offer a loaner or anything during this time. Definately not what I&#39;m use to with appliance companies.

walmart.com	The transaction with walmart.com was excellent. However, there is a problem with the TV where the remote does not allow turn-off. It performs all other functions well, including turn-on, but when I try to turn it off, it does that for less than a second and then turns back on. I have been emailing with Sceptre back and forth numerous times with very unsatisfactory responses. They sent me a new remote which performed the same. I never did think that the problem was with the remote, but followed their instructions. The end result is that they want the TV back to diagnose it. I had to pay someone to to mount it on the wall and connect it for me. Now they are asking me to dismount it, pack it exactly as they instruct and mail it back to them. I asked if it can be merely exchanged at my local Walmart, from where i picked it up, and they said no. This would cost me additional money to have someone dismount it and then remount a now repaired TV. At that point I will have paid more for the TV than if I had bought it at a retail store, not on sale, and significantly more trouble. I am extremely upset with Scepter&#39;s policy on this and will not purchase another item from them.	4.0	5/30/2014

The technician phoned and said that the set was complicated, but he installed a replacement part and got it to work. However, he said, after working for about an hour the unit again refused to turn on and he could do nothing more.

walmart.com	I bought three of these tvs, one a 46in that sometimes cuts off even though i,ve set the timer to off several times. It still cuts off at different times of the day or night. As for the two 32 in i bought they both died out and wont show a pic at all. i bought the first and had this problem then replaced it with another and it also died a little pass the 3 month period to return to Walmart. Although i think they show very well, I,ve not had the best of luck it seems with any of them, so i would not recommend this product to anyone. I will buy something different, i don,t have time to deal with sending it back and fourth with the company.(MY LOSS) Good luck with this product.	4.0	6/9/2015
walmart.com	Bought 04/13/2012 and lasted till 08/24/2012. Sound OK, but NO picture (blank screen). Since my 90 day &#34;no questions asked&#34; by Wal-Mart period had passed, I could not get a refund or product exchange from Wal-Mart. Believe me, it is no easy thing to return a Sceptre product for repair. No simple phone call to a customer service center. You have to request a RMA (via fax) tough if you do not have access to a fax machine. Then you (the customer) are responsible for the shipping charges to California (I live in N.C.) because they repair at their home base. I have bought my last Sceptre product. I fell for the cheap price, but wish I had bought a more reputable companies product for a little more money. Live and learn.	4.0	6/10/2015
walmart.com	This tv worked great for 3 days. then I started having a problem with turning it on. I would have to unplug the set two or more times in order to turn it on. After a couple of days of turning it on and off, it would not come on at all. I returned it to the nearest Walmart and received a gift card for the amount and used it to purchase my grandchildren&#39;s school supplies. I was not happy at all with this purchase and would not recommend this tv to anyone.	5.0	6/10/2015

walmart.com	I set up this TV and while it worked it did have a nice picture and sound. However, after one week it shut down adn would not turn back on. It was a hassle to reak it down and return it to Walmart. Decided to spend a little more andget a good quality TV.	5.0	9/1/2015
walmart.com	It died after 4 MONTHS! No picture just sound. I loved this TV when I purchased it on July 14, 2012. The picture was great and I could hook the TV up to my computer monitor then drag the tab to the TV to watch. The sound was good too. I made it my main TV over my Samsung purchased last Thanksgiving. Other TV&#39;s with all the features this TV has are much more expensive, but it the long it is probably worth. Sceptre is sending me a box so I can send the tv back for repairs. I guess if the TV last for 2 years it would be worth it, although I would hope it would last longer. So my advice is if you are willing to send it back for repairs and the repairs work...it is probably worth the purchase. Now I have to wait to see how long the repair will take. It has already been a week and my box should be here in two more days. I&#39;ll send it back the next day. I hope it doesn&#39;t take longer than 2 weeks.	5.0	8/30/2015

walmart.com	DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I bought this TV on sale with high hopes and was disappointed. The TV worked fine for a couple of months before it started making a buzzing sound. After 5 months of getting used maybe 2-3 hours a day the TV died. No picture, no sound, nothing. I started doing a little more research and found that I am not the only one to have this problem. It&#39;s too late to return or exchange the product and getting it fixed will cost more than the TV is worth. When I buy my replacement for this one, I will be spending a little more money for quality becaues in the end this &#34;deal&#34; wasn&#39;t worth it.	5.0	9/28/2011

walmart.com	We purchased this TV to replace an unknown name brand unit (Element) that died after a little over 5 years of constant use. After just a couple of weeks this unit started muting &amp; unmuting on it&#39;s own. It was also turning off while we were watching it, and no where near the remote. I believe you get what you pay for in this unit. I suggest spending another $50-$75 and get something that has better sound, better picture, and does not self operate. Walmart was great and took the unit back &amp; gave us full credit from the purchase, including the extended warranty (only because they change their return policy during the holidays). If you buy this unit you are taking a chance. I guess it is possible that we got a lemon out of the bunch, but I would not take the same chance again with my money.	Items in cart	3/7/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this television on the first week in May 2014 and the video Board did not work, hence the picture was not clear at all. I do not know if the TV get damage in shipment as FeDEX was the carrier used by Walmart to ship the item, but I am aware of a story carried by the media that showed FeDex employees throwing items, including electronics, to another employee and the electronic or whatever it is would get damage in most cases. I always purchase all my electronics from Brandsmart and the employees would take the TV out of the box connect it to local cable so you can see that it works before giving it to you and I will continue to purchase my TV&#39;s from Brandsmart and never Walmart.com again unless they can guarantee me that they would check the items themselves at the Site-to- Store before giving it to the person present to collect the item. It is disappointing to receive a piece of electronic, ship it to the Caribbean only to find out it is not working, after you have paid someone to collect the TV, deliver it to the shipping company, pay freight and duties and that is sad. Walmart please get it right and check your products, especially electronic, before you give it to persons who order online and use your site -to store service. I am a very disappointed customer and I will never purchase any electronics from Walmart instore or online unless they institute a similar policy as Brandsmart by checking all electronics before giving them to the customer.	5.0	12/19/2011

Also the volume button would not work on the remote...had to use the cable remote, which the code is 500 from the Sony list if you need it. I took it back today. If you do chance buying this I would highly suggest the extended warranty.	5.0	6/20/2012

walmart.com	I have used their computer monitors and thought they were really good in the past. So I decided to give this TV a try. Horrible is the only word I can use. The sound would shrill and distort if anything action wise (ex. explosions) was being played on the TV. The picture quality was subpar in digital or analog format, maybe I am spoiled by my 1080p set. I returned the set and will spend a little extra on a nicer TV.	5.0	8/31/2012

walmart.com	The saying, &#34;if it looks too good to be true, it probably is&#34; certainly rings true here. I was thrilled to have the 32&#34; set at such a fantastic price - for 15 days - then, no picture. Can&#39;t describe how very, very disappointed I am. 15 days to a non-functioning television is NOT a good deal.	Toggle Search	11/16/2012
walmart.com	I may have liked this tv, if it had actually worked. I unpacked it, put it together, and turned the tv on. Nothing. It turned on, but that was it, just a blank gray screen. Tried in another room, thinking maybe there was a short in the outlet, nope. TV was not functioning. When I returned it to the store, the sales associate said that it was the second tv brought in that week (from a site-to-store order) where the tv was broken. I really hate to be that girl that leaves a negative review, but seriously, I was very upset when my tv didn&#39;t work! Bought another one at another store, worked just fine.	Walmart. Save Money.

When plugged in no picture-just color lines. There was a small tear in the box that lines up with what appears to be an impact on the screen. This was a Walmart.com order, so what do I do?	Walmart.

Then on 12/30/12 (5 days of use) my tv went out. No power at all. Brought it back and spent a little more for a Visio. Then on 1/14/13, my son&#39;s tv went out. Same issue with mine.

walmart.com	I was excited when I received the email that my tv had arrived at Walmart to pick up but had to wait until the next day to pick it up because of all the snow and the fact I have an hour drive from where I live in Amish country and the roads are not a priority for the state to clear. I get it unpacked and assemble the stand, have to have the hubby and son move our old heavy crt tv and it comes on and shows the brand name SCEPTRE and then the screen goes blank, I spent 2 days trying different connection types and had a neighbor, my husband and very electronic savvy son all double check my connections because they were convinced I hooked it up wrong since the brand name showed once powered on they assumed the screen operated plus we had sound. I called the tech support once all avenues were exhausted and when I told him all we&#39;d tried he told me it sounds like the video card is bad and it needs returned. Now it&#39;s all unassembled and packed up but I have to wait for the roads to clear again since it&#39;s snowed a couple more days while figuring this out and I&#39;m not sure if it will be worth my time to exchange and then have to make the trip to pick up another or just find another tv while I&#39;m in town. I was hoping to be able to upgrade to a HDTV and not pay top dollar since we have a limited income as I am disabled following a car accident several yrs ago on my way to work. I would recommend taking the time to open the box at the store even though it&#39;s inconvenient and checking to be sure the menu screen comes up when you press the button on the side then at least you&#39;ll know the screen is working beyond the power up that displays the logo.	5.0	12/8/2012

walmart.com	Regrettably I must give this TV a 1. It actually has nothing to do with the product itself but with the way it was shipped. It arrived at my door two days after ordering. OUTSTANDING speed. However the screen was smashed/cracked. As a result I had to return it to the local store. The reason for the 1 is for the fact that they made no attempt to protect the TV from damage. They simply slapped a shipping label on the product package itself and shipped it with no additional packaging protection. So sad. I&#39;m sure the TV is fine if it doesn&#39;t arrive with a shattered screen. First and last TV ordered online. I&#39;ll just go to the store next time.	5.0	12/28/2012

It was not used on a daily basis and shot in less than 3 months. Purchased the extended warranty through Wal-Mart however it should still be covered under the Manufacture.

I have a 50 inch set, so I put this in my guest room. Now I hang out in the guest room more often than ever before. The picture quality is very good. It&#39;s got some kind of built in feature that helps pull in network TV stations that hooked up to just a $30.00 set of Radio Shack Rabbit ears gets pretty good reception for ME. I don&#39;t watch a lot of TV. I hooked it up to a computer, mounted it on the wall and I&#39;m pretty happy with the whole she-bang. I&#39;m not the easiest guy to please in the world. Not the hardest either, I guess. But to re-phrase what I said, I am EXTREMELY pleased with my purchase. There are 3 HDMI ports and a pretty impressive array of options for audio in and out along with other technology packed in.

walmart.com	I got this cause my daughter moved out and I ended up with a guest bedroom and no TV, didn&#39;t want to spend too much money as I figured it wouldn&#39;t get used much, just wanted it incase. All the other TV&#39;s in the house are Vizio and have always liked the Vizio brand, never had any problems, so I was a little skeptical getting a brand I had never heard of! Boy am I glad I got this! Beautifu sharp picture, so easy to set up. My grandaughter goes in the spare room everytime she comes to visit and watches all her shows in there. I&#39;ve had this about a year now and now problems at all. Highly recommend!	5.0	12/26/2011

walmart.com	I purchased the 32 inch Sceptre HDTV to use as a large screen computer monitor. So far, the color and definition have been really good and I have had no problems with it. I tried the VGA port to see how it looked and it was good then switched to the HDMI port and it&#39;s great. I have not used it as a TV so can&#39;t review that feature. The &#34;brushed metal bezel&#34; described is just black plastic with a kind of mat brushed effect applied. It is still black plastic but is less reflective than the smooth black frame. I read several reviews that the monitor had a short life span. I have only had mine for a couple of weeks and hope it lasts a reasonable time. I upgraded to windows 10 with no video problems.

walmart.com	I read the posted reviews on this TV before purchasing if as a Christmas gift for my daughter in Denver (I am in Maryland). My wife and I were heading out to Denver, so we had it shipped to a friend&#39;s house so I could pick it up and surprise our daughter. I received notification that the TV would arrive earlier than expected. Knowing my friend was away at that time, I contacted FedEx and had it delivered at a nearby FedEx store. All worked out well. The TV was really plug-and-play. Picture is great for the pixelation (680) and I agree with the other reviewers that the sound is weak and tinny, but that&#39;s OK for its expected use. I congratulate WalMart and FedEx for excellent shipping and prices.	Invalid city, state or zip code	11/27/2013

walmart.com	Bought this as a gift for someone and it has all the right features and works fine. Not the best picture out there but certainly acceptable. Sound is not great as mentioned by others, but speakers can be hooked up easily enough. Like the fact it has a tuner, a PC hookup as well as HDMI. My house and the recipient of this gift have the entertainment systems based on computers rather than on other audio/visual components, which to me seems like the way to go.	4.0	12/10/2014

walmart.com	This TV is just what I wanted in my bedroom. I gave 4 stars not 5 due to the sound quality, which is not as clear and deep as my living room Samsung TV. But for an upgrade from tube to flat screen and perfect bedroom size this price was perfect. The TV swivels and comes with its own small screw driver for assembly. And if you’re worried because it’s an unknown brand just buy the $20 Wal-Mart protection plan, gives you 2 more years on top of standard 1 year warranty. Great TV for price!	5.0	1/5/2013
walmart.com	I received the TV earlier than the expected date (that&#39;s a plus right there!) The instructions were excellent. I ordered the non-included VGA cable and the hook-up was seemless. The sound is very low through the TV, but great through my PC that I use as a DVD player. I don&#39;t particularly like the &#34;wide screen&#34; view on channels because people look fat or wide, not proportional. For the price, I think it is a good value. All I need now is a home theatre hookup with speakers and I&#39;ll be a happy camper!	5.0	11/29/2011

There was a lot of pixelization and ghosting which made it very difficult to watch. I ended up returning this and purchasing a Vizio 32&#34; elsewhere. $50 more but well worth it.

The sound was poor and the picture wasn&#39;t very good either. I made several adjustments but didn&#39;t feel the tv was worth the $200 I paid so I returned it.

He is satisfied with the one he has now. I don&#39;t know where the problem lies. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the product itself or it was broken in Walmart.	4.0	11/27/2013

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my bedroom. When it finally arrived, I was horrified at the size of it. It looked way smaller than the size it supposedly is. When I called directv to sync the services, this brand name wasn&#39;t even in the database. The remote control is massive and dated. I didn&#39;t waste one second more trying to deal with that. I immediately packed it up and returned it to Walmart. I spent a few dollars more and bought a better one.	5.0	9/3/2014

walmart.com	Not a great TV but a good spare bedroom purchase. Bought at a great price. Sound is very tinny. Picture is clear but only fair-good quality on vivid display. Sports did not pixelate. Easy to place on stand and hook-up with HDMI cable. It will serve fine for its purpose. If you need a TV for anything more than minimal to moderate use go with a major brand. You will pay more but it will be worth it. I might still buy it again at the price knowing what I know.	5.0	2/16/2015

Something was wrong with the one I got and it had to be returned. This would not be so bad but, I live 20+ miles from Wal-Mart. Instead of waiting for a new one to come in I just bought another tv for an extra $40.00 at the store and it works great.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	7/24/2015
walmart.com	Please!!! If you have read any good reviews disregard, This was the worst shopping experience ever not to mention a huge inconvenience! I bought this tv even after reading the reviews couldn&#39;t beat the price or so i thought..after i got this tv home and moved all my furniture around and got rid of my old tv got it all set up worked for 5 minutes then went fuzzy then went black and would not turn on at all. So i had to return it and spend an extra 200 bucks on a different tv.If you do decide to still buy this tv know that if you buy the warranty and your tv craps out and you take it back you will have to CALL walmart customer service department to get your warranty money back..which i have not done yet. The tv i went with is a 42inch hisense the grand total was $$421.88, so far so good! Hope this review helps.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	7/31/2015

walmart.com	I bought this TV for my husband and me. We were getting a blue-ray player as a part of our Christmas present from our daughter so that when the grandchildren bring their movies, we would now be able to play them. The TV we only had it installed about a month. Went to bed one night and turned off TV and the color was fine when we turned it off. Went to turn it on the next morning and then the color displayed was a very terrible green color that actually hurt my eyes to look at that. The box it came in was still saved so we packed the TV and returned it back to Walmart. Customer Service was very helpful and all of our money was refunded. We then went on a shopping trip to see what we could get that might still be in a price range we can afford and the size we needed.	5.0	5/4/2013

walmart.com	I Bought this television for my son&#39;s room. He is an avid video gamer and the standard definition set was not cutting the mustard, as most games are now designed for HD. It was very easy to connect X-box and other electronic devices. The sound quality isn&#39;t the greatest, but is at least average to others I have heard. Actually the picture quality is better than the high end name brand model I have in my bedroom. If my bedroom HD was to fail...I would have no reservations picking one of these up for myself.	5.0	9/6/2013

walmart.com	For $219 and free shipping, I feel like I stole this TV. I unboxed it, hooked it up, and was watching it in less than fifteen minutes. Very user friendly. The picture quality is EXCELLENT. I put this TV in my bedroom, and watched the football game on it Monday night. The picture quality is easily comparable to the 50 inch brand name TV in my living room. I was a little concerned about some of the complaints regarding the sound quality, but after tweaking the controls a little, it sounds FINE. It also has a built in equalizer (very easy to navigate as well), so if you can&#39;t get this sucker to sound decent enough, then you need to buy a more expensive unit. This TV is not marketed to be the primary unit in an expensive theater system, but for what it is and does, it is simply an outstanding value. It was very easy to program my DirecTv remote; if you have a newer model remote-RC65R-there is a code for Sceptre, and my remote accepted it on the first try...no need to use the Sony code as others have stated. I cannot say enough good things about this TV. It was so easy to set up, program the remote, tweak the audio and picture controls, etc. I fully recommend this TV.	4.0	5/1/2015

The picture is beautiful, very sharp. I have trouble with my eyes, and my old fashioned TV just wasn&#39;t doing it anymore. Now with my new purchase, I no longer have those issues. I can see everything beautifully. The only thing about this TV (and it&#39;s not a deal breaker for me), is that the sound is a little bit &#39;tinny.&#39; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good way to explain it or not. It doesn&#39;t really both me, just wanted to let ya&#39;ll know this. I would definetly recommend this TV to anyone. For the price, it was well worth it!	4.0	3/26/2014

walmart.com	I am so happy with my purchase. This was a gift for my fiance&#39;s 90 year old mother. While she is in very good health, a broken hip injury that she suffered five years ago has limited her mobility, so she watches TV often. I told her sons she deserved a new, larger TV for Christmas. They, of course, agreed. We live on fixed incomes, so had to be frugal with our choice. The 32&#34; Sceptre was one we could afford. I read all the reviews and decided to make the purchase. When it arrived, I set the TV up in my bedroom to ascertain that it was in good condition. I was really impressed. More importantly, she loves the television - says that it was the best Christmas present that she ever received.	Invalid city, state or zip code	12/10/2012

Once I figured it out though it went without a hitch. the picture does not come on immediately (as with the old style TV) but I realize there is a difference in quality, sound, picture and all the necessities from the 1990&#39;s to now. This was a good purchase as far as I am concerned and works well in the space in which it is used. Someday I plan to add the extra speakers...but that will be another project for another day.	4.0	12/29/2012

She called me back and loves this TV, she says it seems huge, and the picture is great and it works overall very well. I did buy the 2 yr extended warranty and called the Walmart Center for it and changed the entire warranty into her name. I have since bought through Walmart online the 42 inch version of this same brand of TV. We were going to spend way more on an LED 46 inch with internet capability but after all the Christmas spending decided that a 42 inch LCD for $359.00 would work out just fine.	4.0	7/19/2013

walmart.com	Very good price and arrived after 4 days. Picture and sound good. One pixel is dead - maybe that&#39;s the reason for the low price.	Menu	12/9/2013
walmart.com	An excellent product that far exceeds the price. And it is true that although it is rated at 720p, the high def channels come in at 1080. The picture is sharp and the colors are vibrant. The sound is good, even when playing music. The only reason I gave it a good regards picture quality is that the non-HD channels are not as sharp. Also although it has all the features I need, I am aware that higher price models come with built in wi-fi and other features not available on this tv. But if you are looking for a good hi def tv at an affordable price, this is the one.	Toggle Search	12/10/2013

walmart.com	I was very impressed with this tv for the price. The picture is very clear and the features are easy to use and understand. The only thing that could be better is the sound. The sound is very clear it&#39;s just not a deep type of sound, but it is a flatscreen so it&#39;s understandable. I&#39;m more impressed with this tv than our 55&#34; RCA and our 27&#34; Sanyo and they both cost alot more money.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	2/27/2014
walmart.com	I was told before I purchased this television that it may now work with my computer since I had an older computer. But I checked before I ordered it and it toke the same type of cord as a regular monitor for a desktop computer. I am hoping to eventually get back with Netflix and be able to watch movies on a 32 inch screen. It is awesome doing my searching on the internet with this size screen. Very satisfied with the product and with the service to receive it.	Clear search field	3/25/2014

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my sons age 5 and 6, and I&#39;m considering getting another one for my bedroom. The Value is excellent which made me a little skeptical about the quality of the TV, but so far no complaints. Both picture and sound are good, It has multiple connections in the back, that allow my kids to have their Xbox 360 and wii plug at the same time which is a plus, no need to plug and unplug every time they want to switch consoles. The base swivels. Overall a great value!	Items in cart	7/10/2014

The picture quality is phenomenal, the sound is excellent, setup was a breeze and we love it. I was hesitant to purchase this tv instead of spending more for a more recognizable name. But as it turns out, Sceptre is made by Sony, which i consider to be a very reputable brand. And this tv way exceeded my expectations!! Love it and would recommend it to anyone.	4.0	1/1/2015

This TV has an awesome picture, easy set up, came with a remote, batteries, cleaning cloth, and a screwdriver for assembling the stand if you need it. This TV is well worth the money.

walmart.com	I bought this TV a couple of weeks ago to replace a dead TV in my exercise room. This Sceptre TV has exceeded my expectations. I read some reviews that did not talk highly of the quality and I was a little worried. I have found the TV to be a quality set with a good set of features. I have found the picture quality to be great. I would consider the construction quality to be closer to a flat screen monitor then a high end TV, but for the price paid, it cant be beat.	4.0	3/8/2015

walmart.com	We have a larger HDTV in the living room but my wife hates football. I purchased this set for our office so I could watch football while she has the living room to herself. I had never heard of the Sceptre brand but, for the price, I decided to give it a try. Boy am I glad I did. I must admit that when I first hooked it up I was not impressed with the standard definition picture. I had an HD-DVR installed a couple of days ago and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. The picture is outstanding, the setup was easy and I could not be happier with what I got for what I paid. This may be the best buy I have ever made on a TV set.	4.0	7/28/2015

walmart.com	I am very satisfied with this hdtv. Paid $209 after xmas and mounted with a 29 dollar mount from amazon. Looks great working very well. Remote codes easily found. Works exactly as advertized. Got via (ship to store) for free shipping. Box looked rough but unit works just fine. This tv is made to work with HDMI and digital cable. For all of you wieners that bought this tv and hooked it up to analog cable, then no wonder the picture look grainy. Getting 3 HDMI ports at this price sold me on this deal. Most only have 2 ports at this size. Don&#39;t hesitate to buy this TV and hook it up to digital cable. I have U-verse and it looks great on the HD channels. Only con I have for this tv is that the speaker is in the rear. The sound bounces off the wall and sounds fine. There are many acoustical settings in the setup that can be changed for better sound. If you don&#39;t take the time to set it up correctly then don&#39;t complain if the audio sounds tinny. Was able to get a 27 dollar warranty though http://www.squaretrade.com for 3 years.

walmart.com	We bought this TV when our old 27 inch, non-flat screen, and very heavy TV quit on us. We shopped around but couldn&#39;t find one in our price range. We wanted a 42&#34; but for the money felt like a 32&#34; would be more in our budget and still fit all of our needs. We then came across Walmart&#39;s &#34;Value of the Day&#34; and oredered it. It came in quicker then we expected, two days less then what it originally told us to expect it. It was easy to set up. We don&#39;t have cable or an antennae so we don&#39;t pick up local channels. We mainly got it to watch movies. And it fits our needs very well. We are happy with it.	Enter city, state or zip code	12/16/2014

It also shipped quickly and was simple to set up...We would highly recommend!	4.0	11/21/2011
walmart.com	This TV is a really good buy. Picture and sound are above average. My only complaint is the remote that comes with the TV is terrible. It is hard to hit the channel you want, and it usually adds numbers to the one you are trying to get to and it takes a bit to long for the remote to go to the right channel. But the TV itself is a great product, so don&#39;t let the fact that is a off brand through you.	4.0	1/26/2012

The price is awesome, and we just wanted a decent sized (not too small, not real big) flat screen HD TV to put in our bedroom, so low cost was important. It fits the bill perfectly. We do have HD cable running to it, and it looks good at the 780hp. We were worried what the difference would be from 1080 but we&#39;re happy with it. Very nice looking tv, great size, great price. Hopefully it lasts us a while.	4.0	2/12/2012

I am debating on purchasing this tv for my daughter as well.	4.0	12/11/2011
walmart.com	We bought these to replace the old picture tube set our son had, and our daughters tiny 19&#34; tv. I found out that the company had been making computer monitors for some time, and they had high ratings so I took a chance. I am simply amazed at this value! The ad and the box all rate these as 720p/1080i tvs, but when we hook the PS3 to the set it picks up the signal in 1080p at 60hz. I was stunned and found this to be consistent. Games and movies that broadcast at 1080p have done so every time. Couple this TV with the extended warranty, and you&#39;ve got a 32&#34; LCD value that can&#39;t be beat! We plan on updating the TV in our bedroom and purchasing an additional 2 more at least to update our basement bar with. We added the iLive sound bar to the sets, and they sound great. The built in speakers are so so, but that is any TV pretty much. The sound bar adds a tremendous increase in sound quality, plus it adds a decent FM tuner, port for your portable MP3 player or iPod type devices, and a good digital clock that&#39;s conventiently located for easy viewing.

walmart.com	I wasn&#39;t sure about buying this T.V. because it was pretty cheap, But it did have a lot of good reviews, also a few bad, of course we all know there has to be some bad in every product that is made, also some people you can never please... That being said, by all means, don&#39;t be afraid to buy this tv, the only way you will be disapointed is if you are one of the unlucky ones and get ahold of one of the bad ones, in that case you have 90 days to take it back to walmart for an exchange. This is the easyest tv&#39;s to hook a computer to and switch back and forth that I have ever had. The sound could be a little better but I also have not tried to set it any other way than when it came out of the box. I could not be more pleased!!!!	4.0	12/28/2011

I had to adjust the brightness level since the presets were all too dark for my taste, but with that locked in it&#39;s great. The sound isn&#39;t exceptional, but that&#39;s to be expected with a flat panel. How big can those speakers be, given the size of the cabinet. All things considered, it&#39;s a great value. Buy one.

walmart.com	I purchased this TV to go into a room that I converted from my son&#39;s bedroom to an exercise room when he moved out. The TV was very easy to set up with our DirecTV and my DVD player. The instructions were easy to follow and set up was done in a matter of minutes. The picture quality is good and the sound is good too. I only use the TV when I&#39;m exercising so I don&#39;t watch it a lot but I&#39;m really impressed with it for what I need it for. We also purchased the 40 inch Sceptre for our lake cottage I feel the same way about that TV as well. For the price, you can&#39;t beat these TV&#39;s. I can&#39;t comment on my long term opinion of the TV&#39;s as we&#39;ve only had them for a few weeks, but I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m as satisfied a year from now as I am today. As a side note I ordered them on the internet &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t find them in the store and did the &#34;ship to store&#34; option and they arrived a couple of days earlier than expected and we received text messages and e-mails advising us they were at the store. I will definitely use Walmart&#39;s website again for any major purchase.	4.0	12/29/2011

walmart.com	Like others, I was skeptical of this tv because I hadn&#39;t heard of Sceptre. Of course, there was a time when Vizio was an untried &#34;I&#39;ve never heard of that brand&#34; brand, too. I actually bought 2 tvs the week I got this: a 40&#34; Toshiba LED/LCD from ABC Warehouse for 429.00 and this one for my bedroom. This tv was EXTREMELY easy to set up (and I&#39;m a technically-challenged person; I have never been able to hook up a VCR). The picture is great. The remote is simple and easy to use. A lot of people complain about the sound, which I don&#39;t get because this tv&#39;s sound is WAY better than the Toshiba downstairs. The Toshiba says &#34;You can change the level all you want. I am outputting sound at the level I want to output. So there&#34;. The sound on the Spectre is pretty darn GOOD! The only complaint I might have is that I do hear a faint buzzing noise (VERY FAINT). I&#39;m not actually sure if this is the dvd player or the tv. It&#39;s almost imperceptible. To sum it, this tv was WELL worth the money. It&#39;s still going good over 2 weeks later. Has a very nice, crisp picture. Menus are easy to navigate. Money well spent. Frankly, I like this tv A LOT more than the 40&#34; Toshiba and do wish I had bought the 40&#34; Sceptre (which was cheaper than the Toshiba) for downstairs. Oh well. Live and learn. Next time, I&#39;m buying another Sceptre.	Items in cart	1/8/2012

Bang for our buck, we couldn&#39;t be happier with this. When we got it delivered, we set it all up &amp; noticed that the picture seemed a little cloudy (using an XBox 360 with an HD cord), but figured out that the game settings were set to accommodate our other TV. The only thing we thought we should mention is that the top seems to be more open (like a vent of some kind perhaps?) than our other flat screen - because of this, we expect to get a little extra dust in there, so we bought some compressed air &amp; plan to pay special attention to it. Nothing we aren&#39;t used to because we used to live in the desert &amp; had to clean all the electronics regularly. Certainly nothing that would make us shy from buying this TV again. Great bargain - thanks Walmart! P.S. FYI - the remote signal is the same for older Sony TVs - found that out the hard way when we had a few frustrating mishaps with volume &amp; power going crazy &#34;on it&#39;s own.&#34;	4.0	1/21/2012
walmart.com	Was skeptical to purchase due to other reviews. Went ahead and bought it because it was the best deal. I was going to use it in my camper. I set it up in the house first. Now I like it so much, I&#39;m keeping it in the house and use an old TV in the camper!	4.0	1/22/2012
walmart.com	I&#39;m not a tech savvy person and buying a tv brand name that I&#39;ve never heard of before was a risk, but the price was the big selling point for me especially a tv this size.

walmart.com	I order my 32 inch Sceptre television about over a week ago and had it ship to the store closest to me. I paid about 240 dollars which includes the 2-year warranty and all the taxes. I went yesterday and picked it up the nice man put the T.V. in the cart and I was on my way. I get home and I open up the box in the box you get the T.V. a controller that comes with 2 AAA batteries, a screwdriver, 5-6 screws, a guide and the warranty. I pick together my T.V. by the way the screwdriver and screws are for the base of the T.V., so anyway after setting up the base I hooked up my Xbox 360 with the HDMI cable and when I set my display options on my Xbox 360 to 720p it looked amazing no ghosting while playing or when watching movies on Netflix. The sound quality of this T.V. is way beyond a 5 and so is the picture quality. This T.v is worth the money go pick it up and enjoy it.	Search	1/28/2012

walmart.com	I was needing a new tv&#39;s for our bedrooms so I decided at 32 in would be big enough but I didn&#39;t know exactly how much they would cost. I reviewed is brand and several other &#34;majors brands&#34; but kept coming back to this SCEPTRE 32. After reading reviews I decided to purchase 2. We got them and we were thrilled. The color was very good, the sound is unbelievable!! I have a Sony 46 Google in my living room and my son&#39;s tv from his room is on 8 can I can hear his just as good. The remote is a nice size, it&#39;s long so you can press the buttons quite easily. The instructions for the tv are presented well. Everything comes in a plactic ziplock type bag for safe keeping and the manual itself is in color from front to back. This might not impress many but how many times have you bought a major label and the manual might be black and white or you have to log on to a website for a manual. haha. These tv&#39;s are worth every penny I spent. If you are wanting any of the smart ty features this isn&#39;t for you but once you get a blu ray connect you can have it. The ports are great. The placement on the side of the tv are good. XBOX looks great on tv. This is a solid product don&#39;t under estimate this brand..Happy viewing	4.0	1/29/2012

walmart.com	I was very skeptical before placing the order. I never heard the brand name and read almost 20% of existing customers reviews. Most of the recommended but still many had complains. Most of the people complained on sound quality. Still I ordered this as I had to buy one TV and it was great deal. But when I plugged in this set with NetGear NeoTV , I just got amazed !!! You can’t expect a better picture quality with this price. And I am fully satisfied with sound quality. I found it very loud and normally I am keeping sound at 10% and never crossed 30% so far. I use this set to watch movies on NetFlix, Databazar mainly.	4.0	1/31/2012

walmart.com	I was really happy with my choice of buying this tv. I had heard of the brand before so I decided to give it a try. The picture is great and it turns on quickly. The sound could be better, when I&#39;m playing a game or watching a movie, loud sounds make a static type noise almost like feedback. I had an extra soundbar so I hooked that up to it and the problem was solved. I am overall extremely pleased with this purchase, and happy I saved a good bit vs a better known name brand.	4.0	2/7/2012
walmart.com	I bought this for my bedroom, which is my primary TV watching location. This was my first flat panel HDTV. I&#39;ve been shopping around for a long time but the prices were still too high. I found this online and bought it immediately. The first thing I noticed was how incredibly light it is. I was able to carry the box one-handed using the built in handle. In comparison, it took 2 of us to move the 27&#34; TV I was replacing. Once I got it home, it only took moments to get it up and working. My only concern is that the stand seems a little flimsy. I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t live in earthquake country. Several other reviews mentioned problems with the sound, and I almost bought a sound bar before the TV was delivered, but I&#39;m really glad I waited. I think the sound is just fine. It blasts me out of the room at 10 (out of 100). I was so happy with it that I bought a second one for my son&#39;s room, and am thinking about getting my daughter one as a graduation present next month. I also recommended this to a friend who was complaining about her husband hogging their 1 TV to watch sports. It was in her price range, so she purchased one, too.	4.0	2/8/2012
walmart.com	The tv has been amazing for what we paid for it. I read all the reviews for it and was a little bit nervous to get and was going to give it a week and return it if it was bad but now I am so happy we have it. The sound on it is really good in my opinion. It is clear and travels well. The picture, I think is really good. It isn&#39;t as great as the top notch tv brands but for what I paid I couldn&#39;t be happier. It has a ton of HDMI ports on it as well, I think three, so that makes it really nice as well.	4.0	2/8/2012
walmart.com	Everyone was shocked at the price and how nice it looks. I think they were kicking themselves for not getting this tv! I like my sound loud and plan on hooking it up to a home theater system. All in all this was a good deal for the price, yes I would recommend it!	4.0	2/8/2012

I would highly recommend this TV as a second set and hope that we still feel this way at the end of the summer usage. We were also very pleased with the prompt delivery of this order.	4.0	2/8/2012

The menu features for adjusting screen viewing size are easy to use too, so when we watch old movies they are not stretched out because we are able to set it to &#34;normal&#34; view instead of &#34;wide&#34; view. So far so good. my only complaint was there is only one hook-up for AV, so I could not hook-up both the Dvd/VCR player and the Wii directly into the TV. I had to route the Wii through the DVD/VCR player which we have connected to the TV. But that even works really well, so it is not really a big deal.	4.0	2/19/2012

walmart.com	I&#39;ve had this for better than a month, and it is far better than I&#39;d even hoped for. It is a real bargain. I liked it so well, I bought a second one, slightly fancier (LCD-LED) for another room.	4.0	3/1/2012

walmart.com	This is a great quality TV at an excellent price. I read several reviews before purchasing this TV, all of which were positive.

walmart.com	This was a mothers day present for my mom. It was shipped to her in Puerto Rico. She is very pleased with it and loves the picture quality. I just loved the fact that Walmart was able to deliver this when they said they would. I was afraid of delays but I was so impress that it got there exactly when they said they it would. Loved t hat I was able to track the package as well. I have never considered purchasing a TV on line but due to me being so far away from mom I didnt have a choice. Glad to see that it arrived safely...and in working order. Thanks Walmart for making my 85 year old mom Mothers Day a special one with her new TV that she didnt expect. Might be getting one for myself now. You cant beat the price...	3.0	3/4/2012

walmart.com	I never heard of this brand Sceptre before but for the price I gave it a try and just love it. The value,quality meets all my expectations.	3.0	3/4/2012
walmart.com	I love the picture, I love the sound, love the fact that it was fairly easy and quick to set up and that I got it within three days of ordering it, and I love, love, love the price. After weeks of looking at TVs in every store possible, we decided to take a chance on this one and figured if it was lacking in comparison to the name brands we would return it and spend the extra money to purchase a name brand. Honestly, I can&#39;t see a difference between this and the name brands we saw in the store. However, before this we had an old school TV in both the living room and bedroom, so this was our first flat screen even (the old ones just wouldn&#39;t quit), and so we were watching previously on something rather primitive - lol. They both died at just about the same time, so we bought the 32 inch to try it, with the idea that we will eventually buy a bigger one for the living room and move this into the bedroom. I will stick with this brand though, from going to the stores and looking at the TVs playing, I just can&#39;t see a difference between this and the higher priced ones, so I don&#39;t see a need to pay more for what I think is essentially the same product. It is only the second day with the new TV, so I have not used any features or anything like that yet.	3.0	3/6/2012
walmart.com	I am sooo happy that I chose this TV!!!! It is awesome, and I didn&#39;t have to wait long to get it;the TV was shipped the next day after I ordered and paid for it, and within 5 days it was at the store ready to be picked up.	3.0	3/7/2012

walmart.com	Since I&#39;ve only had this new 32&#34; Sceptre HDTV a few weeks my remarks will be limited. However having said that I am VERY PLEASED with this product so far! I had a little trouble understanding the Owners Manual but when my Time Warner Cable guy came out to install the HTMI cable, he not only gave me some advice on what the DVR box could do, he also showed me how to use the settitngs on the TV menu. This is my first HD TV and to be quite honest, I really don&#39;t see what the big deal is! As far as I can tell there just isn&#39;t much difference in the picture or the sound when viewing a station in HD or just on the regular channel.	3.0	3/17/2012
walmart.com	We were looking for something that doesn&#39;t take up too much room but looks nice and has current features. We found that is this bargain! The description says 720p but the TV has a 1080 setting! We don&#39;t have it mounted, and I love how the TV swivels on its stand. Makes it easier to be moving wires around. (We aren&#39;t tech savvy, I am sure we probably don&#39;t even need to move wires around) Very happy with the purchase so far. We have had it for around a month and don&#39;t watch tons of TV.	3.0	3/17/2012

walmart.com	Is this the best tv on the market? No. Is it a really good tv for the price? Yes! My beloved old style 20 year old Sony tv got hit by lightning so time to get a new one. Bought one from Best Buy and hated the picture and sound. Returned immediately. Read the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try. I am glad I did! If you think it will be as good as a $1000 tv you are just kidding yourself. That said, the picture is very good. The sound is average for a flat panel tv. It took some trial and error to get it to my liking but once I did, I am extremely pleased. I have already recommended this tv to others and would get another if I needed one.	3.0	3/20/2012

The sound is perfect with the options to use the equalizer or the pre-set options like pop, rock, jazz. I enhanced the actual bass and keep the treble balance, and with the volume on 10 it is absolutely clear. Even when commercials play at different levels on my old box TV...does not happen with the Spectre, just equal sound all the way through. The shipping was incredibly fast, I received it about 3 days after ordering. For my first flatscreen this was the best investment I have ever made.	3.0	3/25/2012

As someone else said, if you&#39;re not expecting the quality of an $800 tv, you should be very pleased with this purchase. IMO, with free shipping, this is the best value for a 32&#34; tv that can be had anywhere. Great as a gift!! I highly recommend!	3.0	3/26/2012

walmart.com	I bought this TV for use in a bedroom. It is everything I would have expected in a value TV. Obviously, the colors and picture aren&#39;t LED quality. But, that shouldn&#39;t be your expectation. The picture is more than adequate for my needs and better than the picture on an older Sony LCD that I have. Sound is adequate, though I typically have the volume turned fairly low. I have only had it for about 2 weeks, so I can&#39;t speak to reliability. One thing I was a little bit worried about with such an &#34;off&#34; brand was the ability to find remote control codes for this TV using my DirecTV remote. It took me 20 minutes or so to figure it out, but one of the generic codes worked and appears to have full functionality. You probably won&#39;t brag to your friends that you have this TV, unless your bragging about the great price you got on a decent LCD.	Search	4/13/2012

I purchased these TV&#39;s online and they came with free shipping. I had them delivered to my job and the delivery driver called me, met me at my car, and helped place them in the back seat. Talk about service, the whole experience from start to finish was awesome. I purchased them on Tuesday and they were delivered on Friday of the same week. Three days is all it took and I am a very satisfied customer. The sound quality is better than excellent as a matter of fact, it was pre-programmed on 23 and when the power was turned on the TV was so loud. We keep the sound down to 16 or 17, but I think it goes as high as 60. This is a great buy. Thanks Walmart.	Enter city, state or zip code	4/14/2012

I was really skeptical with the volume of a $180 TV especially when people complained about TV&#39;s that cost $100 more, but I couldn&#39;t be happier. This TV goes to 100, but I only have to run it somewhere between 20 and 30. I have my Playstation 3 hooked up to it through HDMI and the picture is spectacular. The only complaint is that all of the hookups are rear facing except for the RCA jacks. It would be really hard to hook up more peripherals that require HDMI without having to remove the TV from the mounting bracket. This TV is definitely worth the price!	2.0	4/19/2012

Standard settings are pretty flat, but once you tweak the display settings, the picture can actually be quite nice. Can&#39;t beat the price for a 32 inch TV. Would highly recommend to anyone in search of a 32&#34; on a budget. The sound is as basic as it could be on any flat screen, just connect to a sound system, and your set.	2.0	4/20/2012
walmart.com	I used this tv to replace an old 27&#34; tube type in my bedroom. It is a breeze to set up as the only thing you need to put together is the stand which is configured in such a way that mechanically handicapped people can master this task easily. Then, just plug it in and let it cycle once to detect channels and it is set to go. I spent about 30 minutes opening box to walking out of a completed job. As for the picture and sound? Not theatre quality but plenty good enough and cheap enough for a bedroom late nite show type application. I think one would have to have pretty keen eyesite in order to detect the difference between 720 and 1080 and that is not me.	2.0	4/20/2012
walmart.com	Im not sure what I was expecting when I ordered this tv online but let me just say WOW! I am more than pleased with this purchase. I feel like I got more bang for my buck with this purchase than I have in a very long time. I was so impressed by the way the tv was packaged. Everything was neatly organized for easy installation and even includes a screw driver. As far as picture and sound, the regular cable channels werent as sharp but the HD channels are so crisp. I ONLY HAVE BASIC CABLE BTW so the fact that the tv picked up 165 HD channels tickled me pink!. The sound is pretty good. Its clear and it doesn&#39;t need to be cranked way up to understand whats being said. I am so pleased I may buy another for my sons room. This was a fantastic deal!	2.0	4/21/2012

The base of the tv is a neat feature, since you can swivel the tv to different positions (left to right) without moving the whole tv. The picture and sound are great. Very happy that it has the amount of ports it does. Especially since it has an RCA, to hookup her VCR player. I was very happily surprised given the price of the tv and the bad reviews. The box was pretty banged up when I picked it up site-to-store but the tv was packaged very well. 5 stars since it well deserves it.	2.0	4/21/2012

walmart.com	We probably have like 4 laptops and a desktop computer, don&#39;t have cable, we don&#39;t really watch TV. So we had an old 14in obsolete TV that we kept around, in case we wanted to hear the local channel (idk, news?) in the background. Since like 2010 (?) everything is now digital so we started needing the converter box to connect the antenna for the TV so that we can get the local channels. Our converter box broke, and where we checked, the box was going to cost us at least $50 or more. So it was time for us to finally get a slightly bigger flat screen (to avoid needing the converter box). This one was so cheap I thought (with tax it came up to about $206). Delivered fairly quickly in perfect condition. So far so good, things look clear and nice. Oh by the way, I also learned that this TV (or the newer HDTV for that matter) don&#39;t make the weird high pitch sound (that can be heard when the TV is on, only people under certain age can hear). Explains how outdated my old TV was. Nice product for how much you pay.	2.0	4/22/2012
walmart.com	I paid $189 for the TV. It works fantastic. I bought an HDMI cable the day before my TV was delivered and it looks GREAT connected to my DirecTV box on the HD channels. It looks nice and clear and the colors really stand out. I don&#39;t have it mounted on a wall. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to do that yet! The sound is decent. It doesn&#39;t go very loud.. After around 20 it doesn&#39;t really go louder it just stays the same while the numbers say the volume is increasing. It looks really good on the &#34;Vivid&#34; picture settings but it uses more power. If you watch like sports or racing, this wouldn&#39;t be the TV for you because the picture is kinda laggy. It looks blurry when it&#39;s moving fast. Probably due to only being 60Hz. If you&#39;re just watching sitcoms and reality shows and other types of shows then it&#39;d be perfect. I do recommend an external form of audio like computer speakers or a home audio system.	2.0	4/22/2012

walmart.com	Please note that I have only owned the TV for 2 weeks. The TV was delivered to my door very fast. The remote control was DOA so I called Sceptre and they must be having problems with the remote because they took my address and shipped it out immediately and never asked for a serial or invoice number. I got the remote in 3 days. I own a Sony 55&#34;, a Visio 24&#34; 2 sanyo 22&#34;. On a scale of 1 to 10 the Sceptre picture is a 8.5 and features rank a 9.5. GREAT SURPRISE. The sound was, like most LCD TVs was tinny and without any bass response. I expected that. I had a 2.1 (2 speakers and a subwoffer) on hand so I hooked them up to the headphone out jack and much to my surprise the remote volume control also controlled the headphone volume. This is VERY UNUSUAL so I considered it a BIG BONUS. Next test is to see how long it will last.	Clear search field	5/8/2012

walmart.com	Our TV went out without warning, so I researched the least expensive brands and chose this one from Walmart, knowing that at least at Walmart they had a good return policy if the TV was not a good one. So far, we have been very happy with this Sceptre TV. It is lightweight, looks good, is a perfect size for our room, has a great picture and sound and I never thought I had any use for the swivel feature, but when I am watching by myself, I turn the screen completely in my direction and its like watching at the movie theater. With free shipping, the TV was shipped right to my door in just 3 days which was wonderful. No crowded stores, no loading or unloading, just carry it a few steps and hook up only took a few minutes. We love it so far.	4.0	5/11/2012

This has a great HD picture and want to get a couple more to replace our older tube sets. Best price I had ever seen for a 32&#34;, beat out most of the &#39;black-friday&#39; deals.	4.0	5/11/2012

He enjoys it and I haven&#39;t had any complaints from him. Excellent quality product for a low price.

walmart.com	Let me start by saying I originally ordered a Coby from KMart two days before purchasing this one. I read very bad reviews and immediately grew afraid needless to say I returned it after finding this one online at Walmart for a better price with a warranty, free shipping, and better reviews. With standard shipping it came next day (awesome), very easy stand assembly, included screws, screwdriver, remote, and manual. Picture quality is great for a 720. Sound quality is about accurate for the price, it&#39;s no surround sound; but sounds really good. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.

Com-paired to what we had this is extraordinary. Now its not as good as an RCR or any brands as that but honestly it looks wonderful. Its not very thin its about 2 or 3 inches think but it looks great. The stand some times worries me because my kids will move it but so far it has stood up to the test. A baseball even hit the screen and not one thing was messed up on it. Very great TV and I would buy it again. Thinking about getting another one for the bed room. The sound has to be adjusted but once it is its wonderful and the picture needs an adjustment as well. Other than that its a wonderful TV. Only problem I had was with the remote. Its a bit cheap and stopped working about a couple months after we bought the TV. It only turns the volume up or down. Other than that a very great TV for such a low price.	4.0	6/4/2012

I don&#39;t have cable and so I attached my laptop and surf to the networks online to watch my favorite shows. I have my wii and a blueray player connected, also...full entertainment. Now if I could just figure out how to get my ipod to play through the speakers....If I ever lose the remote, it uses Sony codes for a universal.

walmart.com	My TV is everything I expected, and more. I love the sleek lines. It&#39;s lightweight and was very easy to install. The sound quality needs to be tweaked; but I&#39;m not sure if I can adjust it, or if that&#39;s the way it is. The first time I watched a DVD on it, I panicked because there was no sound. I called technical support, and they were very helpful in guiding me as where to plug in the DVD player. It turned out I had installed it wrong. After that it has worked just fine. I feel it&#39;s a very good product for the money I paid.	Menu	6/24/2012

I have no complaints at all, the tv comes with a swivel stand if you want to set on table, great remote w/batteries, screen mat for wiping it down and an easy to follow idiot proof instructions for hooking up surround sound system or dvd etc; multiple picture and sound aspects.

walmart.com	Just right for the bedroom or den. Nice picture that isn&#39;t distorted on a side glance - it&#39;s picture perfect off to a side as well as straight on. Sound is better than I expected after reading some other review. Light weight and sets up fast. Adjusted tint and hue from as-it-came. For the price it can&#39;t be beat ! A three-year warranty is more than reasonable and I always go this way after having too many other purchases fail a short time after the 1-year warranty expires. As I stated, for the price it was a best buy.	1.0	7/1/2012

walmart.com	You can&#39;t beat this 32&#34; TV for price and quality. Picture is bright and sharp. Several months ago I bought a Sceptre 16&#34; TV for my home desk. The sound needed computer speakers, but for $79 I have no complaints. Now paying $180.00 for the 32&#34;, I couldn&#39;t be more happy. The 32&#34; needed some Eq adjustment with the sound, but I don&#39;t feel I need external speakers like the 16&#34;. I have other TV brands that cost many times more, and I can tell you those other TV don&#39;t justify their higher prices I paid for them. If you are afraid of a lesser known brand of Sceptre, spend another $19 for a 3 year warranty. Walmart shipping on both TVs arrived 2 days earlier than listed on-line. I&#39;m also impressed that both these TVs are so much more energy efficient compared to other TVs I own. The 32&#34; draws only 59w and the 16&#34; draws 13w according to my &#34;Kill-A-Watt&#34; meter. Why spend double or more when these Sceptres do such an excellent job for a basic HDTV.

walmart.com	This TV has a lot of options and whiz bang things I don&#39;t need now but some day I may be able to take advantage of them. The picture is as good as I could ask for. It is a 720 TV so if you have to have the best picture available, you should buy a 1080 but you won&#39;t get it at this price. To tell you the truth, I can&#39;t tell the difference between this TV and my 1080 TV. Maybe if I sat five feet from the TV, I could see a difference. At normal viewing distance, they both look great. This is my sixth flat screen TV. I have one 1080 and now five 720&#39;s. This TV ranks right up near the top of the list. The 1080 wins out but only because it is a 55&#34;. It&#39;s hard for a 32&#34; to compete with a 55&#34; but it is very close. The light sensor that adjusts the picture depending on the amount of room light is a nice feature and you don&#39;t even have to do anything to take advantage of it. There are many input and output options so you can see videos and/or pictures from just about anything that puts them out. I was surprised that there were three HDMI connectors on the back of this TV. At this price I would think you would only get one. For those who want to have a BIG computer screen, this will fill the bill because it also has a computer input on the rear. Another thing that may be useful is the USB connector. With this input you can play music or view your photos/videos from a flash drive. There is nothing that I dislike about this TV. It&#39;s easy to assemble the stand (only 7 screws). That&#39;s it. Just plug it in, connect your video source and put the batteries in the remote. Thanks Sceptre for a great TV and thanks Wal Mart for a great price.	5.0	8/15/2012

It has a great picture, the sound is fine and the features, which I don&#39;t use hardly at all is okay, I guess, but I find no real problems with it at all. It&#39;s price is just right for the size and it&#39;s qualities are right for this tv.	4.0	8/26/2012

walmart.com	This is my first HD TV ever and is working well for me after 7 months of owning it. Picture is crisp and bright. All the input and output jacks make it easy to connect lots of things like DVD, Cable Box, Roku Player, Nintendo Wii and external speakers all at the same time. Great value for the money. Screen is low glare which means I can have my living room table lamps on without seeing their reflections. Sound is only average, even after fiddling with the equalizer. Not bad, just not a lot of richness, and some obvious distortions (like buzzing for some sounds) even at medium volumes. So using a simple red/white RCA cable, I hooked up an old audio amplifier and a pair of bookshelf speakers. Downside is that now there is no remote volume control, but for watching movies and streaming music over Pandora with Roku, the difference in sound quality is night and day. Would recommend a similar old stereo setup, or even a sound bar system if good audio is important to you. Back to the over-all TV experience, remember that this is my main TV and gets lots of use every day. I wanted an inexpensive way to get started in HD television. Many of my local broadcasters, especially sports broadcast in the 720p format - same as this TV. At this size class (32 inches diagonal) there isn&#39;t much difference between that and 1080i, and I am happy with the picture fidelity. Will the X333BV last as long as my old tube TV did? Probably not, but at this price I am pleased with my purchase.	1.0	11/19/2012

walmart.com	I was a little nervous about the sound quality after reading the other reviews. Since the reviews were mixed, I went ahead and gambled that the sound would be fine. I bought this for my daughter&#39;s room. No, it doesn&#39;t have all of the new bells and whistles, but it is a very good TV. We have only had it plugged in for 2 days, so I can&#39;t comment on durability at this time. However, I will definitely update if I have problems. For the price, I would highly recommend the TV.

walmart.com	At 32 inches, it just doesn&#39;t get better than this! We put this in our living room and got it on line for 179.99 just before christmas. It was recently being sold for 197, but still a great deal for this TV. Works Great as long as you have HD. I pay 5 bucks a month for charter HD and it is well worth it. This TV replaced an older 27 inch tube... so for us 32 is plenty big enough and the electric bill won&#39;t be any more than it used to be. This TV will actually use less power... Other than the typical sound issues, this has been great so far. Have had it going for about a week, so I can&#39;t speak to longevity issues, but from the other reviews it seems to be lasting fairly long. But just to make sure, I purchased the 3 year extended warranty for 20 bucks, so that made my total 210.00 I hope this helps.	Toggle Search	11/22/2012

A friend of mine at work said he had bought one (not this brand) and the picture was horrible when watching normal TV so now I was worried even though the main purpose was for gaming. But this TV is awesome!. The picture is crystal clear. I only have an antenna, no cable or anything and when it set up the channels it found 118, everyone of them comes in perfect. With all the inputs and outputs I can do everything I need and more. I got it at a great price. They raised it after I bought it but to me it&#39;s still worth the money.

walmart.com	I took this out of the box, plugged it in, and it auto set to the channels. The channels are different than my old non-flat screen TV, so I have to get used to it. For example the old TV was channels 1-100 (no cable box at this location in the house). This new TV has 1-112, but has A, B, C D after some of the channels. The picture quality is great, the sound is different, almost like I&#39;d like speakers, but totally fine, its just different than the old style TV audio. Some channels dont fill the screen, but that would be the same depending on what I am playing. For $188.00 and no shipping this fully meets expectations and usage requirements.	4.0	11/24/2012

We are using the tabletop stand that comes with it and it does seem a little &#39;loose&#34; on the stand but we think that is because of the little swivel it has.

With it being an off-brand and not a name brand, we werent sure about the quality. But the picture quality was great, and the sound was wonderful!! My parents were very impressed, and couldnt believe the difference in the new TV from their old one. Despite the new one technically being 2&#34; smaller, they dont even notice the difference and enjoy it so much more! I think for the price and the quality of what was gotten, this was a WONDERFUL TV!!!!!!!	1.0	12/3/2012

walmart.com	For a 720p 60Hz HDTV, this TV has an excellent picture. The sound is really good when you adjust the treble, midrange, and bass for your personal needs. Many people forget to do this. The AVL (auto volume level) option allows you to eliminate that annoying volume increase with commercials. There are all the options you need for a TV.

It is also very good in a dual monitor computer configuration for web, artwork, and small details like large spreadsheets. I am also impressed with its range of inputs and outputs.	5.0	12/6/2012

walmart.com	I read the reviews from people who bought the Sceptre 32&#34; Class LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV, X322BV-HD and I was encouraged to buy this product online. We&#39;ve only had this tv for about a week, but I can see it&#39;s a great product for the money....simple as that. I noticed there are some reviewers here giving out a lot of unnecessary technical explanations about this tv that are useless for most people. All I needed to know what that it had a good resolution, good color, good sound....this tv meets all those requirements. We&#39;re not talking about a $2,000.- tv, folks....just $200.- so why all the sophisticated hight tech reviews?? lol, lol, lol. I would definitely recommend this Sceptre model to people who are looking for a good, inexpensive television. Enough said.

In addition, the product includes a number of conveniences that did not come with our Samsung TVs such as a screwdriver to put it together, a cloth to wipe the screen and a swivel built into the base that allows you to easily swivel the screen. Also, the manual was the best manual I have seen of any electronic product that we have purchased recently and certainly much better than the two larger Samsung TVs that we recently purchased. All things considered this is a great product for the price.	5.0	12/10/2012

walmart.com	Bought this TV for the master bedroom. I purchased online and had it shipped directly to my house. TV was easy to set up and very light weight (compared to the 27 inch tube TV it replaced). The remote control was defective out of the box. However, we have another Sceptre TV in one of the other bedrooms and I was able to set it up using that. After that I can use the cable box remote. I contacted Walmart about the remote and they gave me the option of returning the whole package (TV and remote) for exchange or to contact Sceptre via email and deal directly with them. Since Walmart gives you 30 days, I figured I would try dealing with Sceptre and if that didn&#39;t work I could still return. I emailed Sceptre and received a reply indicating that they would mail a new remote to me. 3 days later a new remote arrived in the mail. Great customer service and they have earned a loyal customer.	5.0	12/14/2012

Crystal clear picture, even better than when they were on cable. Easy set up and they can hook up their laptop in a second to stream video, watch a DVD, watch Netflix.	Search	12/20/2012
walmart.com	This tv, is the first tv I have ever bought by myself. I paid the decent price and had some sceptilations (thinking.. that was really cheap.. is it going to be cheap?) but it was not! This tv has a great picture with Charter Communications. Has not let me down and I have had it since the end of Feburary beggining of March or 2013. The only thing I have a proublem with is the sound. The speakers are a little quiet. While I am trying to save the money to buy a speaker bar (will screw into the bottem of the tv.. they are made for this brand and tv.) I have a set of ajustable computer speakers plugged into the headphone jack on the back and have it turned up that way! Wonderful tv.. I would recomend this tv to anyone who wanted a cheap, yet reliable tv!	Items in cart	12/20/2012

walmart.com	My previous TV was quite old and needed a whole mess of wires to watch anything. It ended up being only about $50 to get a new TV than to mess around with the old one, so that&#39;s what I did. The initial set-up was very straight-forward. I love that the TV is able to rotate about 40 degrees to the left and right, so I can still watch shows while I&#39;m cooking in the kitchen. I don&#39;t know a whole lot about the technical aspects of TVs, but the picture quality appears quite sharp, and the sound is top-notch. It looks like it has the ability to go up to about 50 notches in volume, but I&#39;ve never needed it above 10. For a 32&#34; TV, this one&#39;s a good value, thus far, for the cost.	4.0	12/21/2012

walmart.com	The TV frame and integral mount are quality and the rigidity of the stand was superior to other brands I have seen. This TV is capable of cable or over the air digital TV. I recently purchased a rotating antenna which gave me 10 additional viewable channels for a total of 14 out of 19 channels. This TV has an integrated digital receiver so my intention was to throw away the additional digital box and clean up the the TV&#39;s appearance in the room, and finally appear somewhat contemporary. This digital receiver picked up less channels than my old TV with the digital box but the picture was incredibly clear; the sound was super. However, this TV does not have a digital signal strength meter to allow me to rotate my antenna to pick up the additional channels- I would have to keep the digital box that I already have. The manual says the set requires ??% signal strength for over the air digital TV or the picture or sound may not operate and one needs to contact the cable or satellite company to adjust the strength. The bottom line is this set is perfectly priced and it will astonish those of you with old-world technology on cable or satellite systems, it will even perform well on digital air TV if somehow you can point the antenna without a signal strength meter.	1.0	1/17/2013

walmart.com	While I bought this tv as a gift, I picked it up, (Wal-Mart site to store is PHENOMINAL!!!) My brother installed it, and it was incredibly easy to hook everything up. When we had questions of how to proceed, the owners manual was concise and precise. The TV was hooked up to cable, and the picture is a very high quality, sharp images. What I especially liked was the USB port hook up, to me that will be all the difference in viewing pictures and other type media. WalMart, thank you. Sceptre, thank you. I definitely and highly recommend this TV, and would purchase another one in a heart beat. The question now is, how long will it last.	Invalid city, state or zip code	1/26/2013

This model at 720p enabled a much lower price for the 32 inch tv. Hookup was easy and had not only HDMI but a full range of other plug-ins for older equipement such as the digital tv box. Bought a new dvd player with hdmi cables and it works just fine on the Sceptre.

walmart.com	I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting anything really good out of this TV so I was pleasantly surprised. I only watch a couple of things a week (no sports or super fast action) so I can&#39;t comment on how well it works for all types of programming, but it does just fine for regular shows. I have it set up about 8 feet from where I sit and the resolution and clarity is excellent. To me the sound isn&#39;t bad at all but I can see where someone who watches movies would want better and would probably own a surround sound set up anyway. I&#39;ve only had it a month so I can&#39;t comment on longevity but so far so good.	2.0	3/25/2013
walmart.com	We bought this for our 2nd home and didn&#39;t expect a lot for the price. It was surprisingly good in the picture quality area, sound is poor to OK. I have the sound coming through an external sound set-up so it sounds great this way (same as what we do for our LG 55&#34; TV). Picture is bright enough, very good color, no Internet or other features like this. No problem if you have an Apple TV, Roku, etc. Would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 2nd, or bedroom / den, rev-room / garage TV.	1.0	3/25/2013

My son went from averageing a score of 11-15 kills to a high of 38 kills! Great for COD MW3 as well! The XBOX 360 avatar menu actualy shows 4-1/2 users at a time instead of just 3 to select from.

Therefore I had to order another one for the den. I love the sumple to understand remote control. Setup was a breezy. I only have to have the volume on 1. The 19&#34; (other brand) originally had by my bed had to have it&#39;s volume up all the way for me to hear it. I set everything internally on the volume and I still had a hard time hearing it.

walmart.com	I got this TV on Black Friday for $170. For a 32&#39;&#39; TV its price is very worthy. The image quality looks good to me (although I don&#39;t have high requirement for that). I connected it to my wii u, and everything works fine up to now.	5.0	8/28/2013

walmart.com	With some &#34;fine tuning&#34; for personal preference it has a great picture. I found the &#34;Dynamic&#34; as well as the &#34;Vivid&#34; settings to be personally most pleasing. The orange &#34;sound&#34; button and the &#34;picture&#34; button on the remote really made a difference. I did find the sound to be a little &#34;tinny&#34; as some of the other reviewers commented on. I turned the bass up to the maximum and then it was fine. Sceptre is made by Hitachi and so far I am very pleased with the product. It is used daily for TV watching in the bedroom. You can&#39;t beat the price.	5.0	8/28/2013

walmart.com	An unfamiliar brand, but an unbeatable price. It is very slim and has decent picture quality. Sound is a little small, have to turn it up to mid forties in volume to really hear it. However, that is the way most these flat screens are designed, with the picture in mind and very little effort given to sound. Would recommend getting a sound bar or some type of extra speakers with this TV.	5.0	9/12/2013
walmart.com	It&#39;s not 1080p, but you don&#39;t really need that for most things. The picture is a bit crisper than my old HDTV and the sound is better. It also has quite a few ways to change up the sound that I enjoy. It&#39;s good for its price definitely.	Menu	9/12/2013

Wow, what a difference. This Sceptre has a better picture, more features, more controls and adjustments possible (picture, etc)..AND it can play MP3s from a USB drive plugged into it...AND it can play those MP3s at the same time it plays a slideshow of your pictures on that same USB drive. The Insigina cannot do this. Hopefully this Sceptre will hold up for the long run.	Menu	9/29/2013

walmart.com	Love it! Got it at an excellent price! Like the fact that the TV will swivel on it&#39;s base so that others that are not directly in front of the TV can also get a good view. Just wish the sound menu would come with a game option. Certain games have specific sounds either raised or lowered and if they are raised, they blare through the TV, leaving the lowered sounds sounding muffled. To do away with this problem, I turn on my surround speakers and continue playing. Overall a great buy!	4.0	10/12/2013

The set has 3 HDMI ports and this too, was also an important feature that made me decide on getting this HDTV.

walmart.com	The TV tuner didn&#39;t really work for me (at least in my bedroom in NYC) but I was able to connect my Leaf Plus and was able to get all the basic channels without issues. 3 HDMI&#39;s is great as most TV&#39;s in this price range only have 2 inputs. It works well with my Google Chromecast and Apple TV. Although it&#39;s 720p - you can&#39;t really tell the difference since the TV is small. Overall, great product for less than 200USD. I&#39;ve read some reviews that this unit wouldn&#39;t last more than 10-12 months. I&#39;ve only had it for 1.5 months so it&#39;s hard to gauge. With this price - it makes sense to replace it every other year.	4.0	12/3/2013

The sound is a little off, but it&#39;s all good after you tweak the equalizer a little. My only complaint is the remote it came with; I don&#39;t know how to program it and the instruction manual isn&#39;t very helpful. All it says is that it &#34;follows Sony&#39;s programing code&#34; and that I would have to &#34;refer to my universal or cable/satellite remote manual&#34;. Still, I love this TV.

walmart.com	I just bought my 2nd Sceptre 32&#34; 720p since it was on clearance and I was thinking of getting a tv for the guest bedroom. I have had my 1st one for about 1 1/2 years now and the picture and sound is still great. My husband likes to have the tv on all night long and since he is retired, he takes his little senior naps with it on so it is virtually on more than its off. I have a 50&#34; Panasonic in the living room and this one can run with the big boys. For the reasonable price it sells for I may just get a 3rd one for a back up.	5.0	2/19/2014

walmart.com	I purchased this 32&#34; Sceptre for my bedroom after reading many positive reviews. With a cost of nearly $100 less than anything in its class, I decided it was worth the gamble. Shipping was free, and arrived in 4 days. Setup was easy, and was able to use my existing wall mount (400mm x 200mm) from my old 26&#34; tv. Sound quality leaves a bit to be desired, but picture is absolutely beautiful! I added a $25 2.1 computer sound system with sub-woofer, plugged it into the headphone jack, and now have quality sound.

walmart.com	We&#39;ve had a 32&#34; LED HDTV Sceptre (1080P-60Hz) in our bedroom for almost 3 years that we love and haven&#39;t had a single problem with it (also purchased through WalMart.com). Felt comfortable enough to recommend as a combined family birthday present. Picked this one because birthday girl has cable that only supports 720P (1080P would have been a waste). Great picture, sound is fine for us normal people, great price, free super fast delivery right to our front door -- what&#39;s not to love? Also purchased the $24.00 4-year warranty. Hope we never need it but just in case we decided &#34;can we really not afford to insure this for only $6.00 per year?&#34;	5.0	2/27/2014

Set up was VERY easy, and this TV comes with it&#39;s own stand. They even include a screwdriver to install the 8 screws into the base!

walmart.com	This was the tv we got for Black Friday&#39;s $99 32 inch tv sale. We bought it for our 8 year old daughter for Christmas. My husband hung it on the wall, hooked up the dvd player, had Dish come out to install a box for her and now she is in her own dream world! This tv is great! I have sat in her room watching it with her and I have to say it is pretty great. The picture is as good, if not better, than the more expensive ones we have in the rest of our house. The sound is great too, of course she doesn&#39;t have to turn it up too loud since it is just her and she usually has no other noise to compete with. I know I got a great deal on this and hope they offer them again because I will buy a few more for presents!	5.0	3/25/2014

walmart.com	Bright, sharp picture. Lots of ports to plug it in. Was ready to use out of the box in 15 minutes. The only downside is that its mounting holes were neither VESA 75 or 100 standard separation. I had planned on using a mount that previously held a 24&#34; computer monitor and the mounts won&#39;t fit, even though the mount will hold both the size and weight of the TV. It is very difficult to find a desk mount for anything other than 75 or 100 and I did not want to put holes in the wall.	5.0	4/7/2014

I was very pleased with how easy it was to setup the TV which was just place it on its stand plug it in and it was ready. The picture is phenomenal. This is my first HD TV so I was surprised out how clear and detailed everything looks. I&#39;m currently using my TV as a computer monitor and it really is enhanced my gaming experience. I play a lot of online games and the graphics are great. Left4Dead 2 looks so good on this TV. When my daughter saw my TV and how great it is for gaming I had to purchase her one too for her PS3, which by the way the 3 HMDI ports are a blessing because switching between computer/console is a breeze with a press of the button. However I would suggest investing in a great pair of speakers because the sound is rather low but then again it could just be because I have it connected to my computer via a mini jack audio plug. If you are looking for a new computer monitor or just a great TV look no further.	5.0	6/2/2014

Ty the way, the reviews were excellent by the way of being informative and helpful. This TV has 3 HDMI inputs which is more than my more expensive TV in the living room! Although it took me more than 5 minutes to connect, (about 15), the picture is vibrant and clear using the HDMI cable, not so great using the regular cable. It is the perfect size for my bedroom which is why I bought it. I have had no trouble since I powered own and am thoroughly enjoying it! Thank you Walmart.

Made by Sony, it is a great picture. I don&#39;t use the regular speakers, and I&#39;m pretty sure that if I had to, they would be fine for this not too small, not too large tv. So good, in fact, I&#39;m now taking a serious plunge on a sceptre 49 in 4k tv that I got the best black fFriday/cyber Monday deal on! I&#39;ll keep you posted....	5.0	6/13/2014

walmart.com	I can&#39;t say one bad thing about this TV. A few features even surprised me, because I&#39;ve not seen them my other TVs before. First, it has a swivel base and can rotate easily left and right. Second, they included a cleaning cloth! Finally, it can set its time and date automatically. Sceptre is going to give the other brands a real run for their money! They also have a great web site, too.	5.0	6/15/2014

walmart.com	For the first time EVER (at age 66) I have a TV in my room. It is perfect size &amp; quality. One thing I should point out to you. I ordered late Tuesday online. Received an e-mail on Thursday 12-04-14 it had been shipped (very quick service). The e-mail said I would receive by Dec. 20th. Therefore, I was quite surprised when I received a phone call before 6 PM Thursday stating my TV was left in their driveway/sidewalk area. It clearly showed it was the picture &amp; description. She took pocession to protect it, called me that night &amp; delivered it to my door. I gave her a gift (a teddy bear I had purchased as a Christmas present for someone else) I so appreciated her honesty. FedEx was the shipping company. Thank you! Kathie	5.0	6/30/2014

walmart.com	I ordered this tv on Cyber Monday and it came a week before the scheduled delivery time. Now that might be bad if I was going to be out of town, but since I was home it was ok. You have to put a few (6-8?) screws in the stand to set it up but the screwdriver that comes with it is inadequate so just use your own. It only takes a few minutes. The tv isn&#39;t very loud, so you might want to connect it to a speaker system. Overall I&#39;d recommend it as a cheap guest/not main TV.	Toggle Search	7/4/2014

walmart.com	Bought this TV after my son and his friend broke the screen on my 2nd Plasma with a Wii remote. While it&#39;s only used for gaming, it has a surprisingly great picture for a low end TV. The sound is lacking as expected from a flat screen which is why I didn&#39;t reduce the rating. A quick search on the internet for calibration settings and the picture is near perfect and out performs my older but higher end 32&#34; LCD Samsung. If you&#39;re looking for a low budget TV with high quality picture then look no further.	5.0	7/31/2014

With all its features and multi HDMI jacks, USB jack ,Audio out jack and the others as well it takes care of ALL the components I have and gives me the ability to use my stereo system for added listening enjoyment. I find the matte screen to be excellent for fighting glare and the ability to swivel the screen adds for perfect viewing from multiple angles. The hookup instructions were easy to follow and the added screwdriver made assembly quick;the screen cleaning cloth was also very useful. In addition to these values I found the customer service people knowledgeable and friendly. I would recommend this television to anyone who is looking for a great product at an unbelievable price decide for yourself as I did.

walmart.com	We bought this TV for our master bedroom to replace our tiny 19&#34; and I&#39;ve got to tell you it is great. I research EVERYTHING before I buy something and read a whole bunch of reviews here regarding this TV. The first thing that you have to realize when reading reviews is to review the product - not Walmart or the dockworker, shipping company or how the weather is. The bottom line is this TV has a great picture and the sound is perfect. The sound was my big shopping/selection issue because we run a ceiling fan and an oscillating fan every night and we needed enough volume so it wouldn&#39;t be drowned out by the fans. This TV has it. Can&#39;t beat the price and has all of the input/output plugs that you will require. I run it using OTA antenna and get as good of picture as the very expensive Samsung in our family room.	5.0	11/17/2014

walmart.com	I was initially told by walmart people that this brand was the bottom of the major brands - but that it was still a good tv.

Well my daughter talked me into getting this TV, they didn&#39;t have this particular one at my local store but I was able to get an idea of the size and weight and went home and ordered it online. Shipping to my home was supposed to take one week, however it arrived in two days. Lucky for me my daughter was still visiting and she set it all up which took her about five minutes. I love it, I love the picture, the sound, the remote, everything about this TV plus the fact that it swivels to boot. Great TV for the bedroom, at a wonderful price.	5.0	12/18/2014
walmart.com	I ordered this unit online on a Tuesday requesting the standard free shipping. My new Sceptre was delivered to my front door on Thursday the same week. It was well packaged and easy to set up. It does come with a small screwdriver for attaching the base, but a regular size Phillips was much easier to use. Set up was simple and the picture is crisp and clear with awesome color.	5.0	12/18/2014

walmart.com	Like most of the reviews, I can only say these are better than great buys for your money. I originally bought a 50&#34; for my home which was great right out of the box and has been since I got it 8 mos. ago. I then purchased another 50&#34; for my business along with two 32&#34; TV&#39;s as well. If you looking for a great buy, this is it! The parts are from Sony but without the name and frills. I have less than $1,100.00 in all 4 TV&#39;s even with the warranty plans!	Menu	12/19/2014
walmart.com	This is the second 32&#34; Sceptre TV I have purchased. One for myself and another for my Son. It is a great LED TV for the money. The picture is great, the remote control is very easy to use &amp; all the plug ins are easy to reach &amp; easily identifiable. The TV itself looks great and very modern with swivel base. I would definitely recommend this TV, especially if money is tight.	Toggle Search	12/19/2014

walmart.com	This is the second TV that I have purchased by this manufacturer. The first was a 50&#34; for my Dad for Christmas and this one for my self to replace a 19&#34; flat screen that I had. The reviews are worth reading, most of the things written (at least on the positive side) are true. The picture is bright and clear, you have several screen options (Wide, Normal, Cinema, Zoom, etc), you have a few audio options, the menu system is easy to navigate and understand. This is well worth the price.	Clear search field	12/19/2014

I received the box rather quickly and what my husband was even more impressed with was the fact the box came with a screwdriver to put it together and a cleaning cloth for the TV along with everything else that was included in the package. Pretty simple for him to put together in less then 20 minutes and it&#39;s a decent size upgrade for us. We are slowly still replacing old TVs with newer flatscreen&#39;s so the sale was really a steal for us. We love sales but it also has to be a good product and this really is.

The base has a nice turn feature which is great considering the way the TV is set up its easy to see if you&#39;re in bed or if you&#39;re on the love seat. Just turn the tv a little and viola. My only real &#34;complaint&#34; is the remote with a thousand buttons. It&#39;s pretty much a universal style remote, so if you are getting his for a non tech savvy person the remote will be a bit confusing.

walmart.com	I bought this 32&#34; Sceptre after seeing the 24&#34; my son bought. Let me say first that I am not a fan of flat screen TVs. I much prefer the old CRTs. One main reason is the sound quality. Even the most expensive flat screen has little speakers that give you a tinny, offensive sound quality. I was able to adjust the picture, brightness, color, etc on this TV to create the experience perfect for me, but I couldn&#39;t get used to the sound. However, a set of speakers for $20 solved that problem for me. I am very happy with the size of the screen, the picture quality and the features of this television. It has 3 HDMI ports, USB port, composite, VGA and coax as well. Whatever your set up for cable or broadcast or streaming entertainment, you will be able to hook up all the devices you could possibly want. So far, I am very happy with the purchase, the TV is a great value at Walmart&#39;s low price - it&#39;s $10 less now than when I bought it!	5.0	2/5/2015

walmart.com	I purchased this on line and had it delivered to my home address for FREE and you can&#39;t beat that price. When I went to open the box, wasn&#39;t expecting a TV in it due to the weight. I was shocked to see how easy it was to put the base together, they even give a free screw driver for the base mounting. The only problem with I had found is that the speakers are in the rear and when you have it in a entertainment center. I have to purchase a sound bar to get good sound. The picture is really great, the only problem I had as setup was the remote control. I have Dish TV and they have their own remote and it won&#39;t work as a single remote. I have to use 2 remotes, 1 to adjust the sound and turn on &amp; off, and the other for channels and grid and recordings. Other then that I really like this TV and would buy another one but larger one for my bedroom!	5.0	2/27/2015

walmart.com	I have been living with 3 tvs in my house that were 15 to 25 years old. The price of newer tvs have always been too expensive for me to upgrade. After my 32&#34; older tv died I had to finally look for a tv I could afford. Not only did I need an affordable tv, I also needed a tv that had a quam tuner in it because I only have one cable box in my house. I came across the Sceptre at Walmart.com. Not only was it on sale but it also had a quam tuner. It was so easy to hook up and once I turned it on, I felt like I was at a movie theatre. Beautiful vivid color. So easy to make any adjustments with the remote. Why anyone would pay hundreds of dollars for a tv when the Sceptre is all you need.	5.0	5/28/2015

walmart.com	this TV was actually purchased for me by some people who wanted to make sure that I have entertainment for my new place! The TV turned out to be such an unexpected surprise, that when it was time for me to buy a bigger TV, I chose Sceptre, this time there are 49 in ultra HD! I&#39;ve got it almost a year now, I haven&#39;t had one problem with it either.	5.0	6/24/2015

walmart.com	I like this tv for mostly all of it&#39;s features and functions. The only thing i&#39;m not completely happy with is the sound. The tv can be difficult to hear effectively with any other outside noise, such as a fan. The speakers must not be a high enough grade to have more amplification behind them. I usually have to turn on the surround sound receiver to hear it effectively. One other small thing. The swivel set up that mounts the tv to it&#39;s stand is a little too wobbly. This tv has an excellent picture. I sit only 4 feet away and it is sharp, crisp and has very good contrast and brilliant color. The details you see with 720p is very surprising. Sometimes there is more detail on facial closeups than i want to see. With the addition of my bluray player with wifi and Chromecast it has become a smart tv, when needed. I give it 5 stars because the faults are very small, and most flat screen tv&#39;s suffer from insufficient sound. This is something that all tv makers need to work on.	5.0	6/28/2015

(kinda hard to explain) even with mutiple attempts to adjust it. its a little off still ,but not a deal breaker. good value at 229.00 dollars.	4.0	8/5/2015

We decided to go cheap and this looked like the best value for our tight budget. We were extra suprised to receive the tv the next day although we did not opt for next day shippment. We unpacked and plugged in (we do not have any piped in t.v.) to DVD and VCR and our four little boys immediately were able to watch (modern television). The sound was terrible so we added some old P.C. speakers (Harman Kardon) and they worked excellent. We do have a lot of other tech items such as android phone, digital camera and p.c. so we can utilize the t.v. for other things instead of cable or air. All in all we love our t.v. Thanks.	5.0	8/6/2015
walmart.com	Needed a new TV, and this one was a good size and a decent value. The 3 HDMI ports were also a big factor. They allow you to have a computer, gaming system, and cable all hooked up at the same time. It also comes with an adjustable base/mount that makes positionion/changing screen direction simple. And it is pretty light weight. Really good picture quality, sound is somewhat lacking but not a real problem. Overall I&#39;d say it was a good purchase. Only had the tv a few weeks, and had not previously owned/even heard of the Sceptre brand. All in all I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product for such a low price/unknown brand.	5.0	8/6/2015

It was a bit fuzzy. We played with it and it is better now. we will have to buy another DVR to use the HDMI hook up. Just little things dealing with hook ups i was going to take it back, but my husband talked me out of it. We will just update our electronics.

I noticed when I have the volume turned up past a certain point, the sound gets so &#34;tinny&#34; sounding it actually hurts my ears. Maybe someday I&#39;ll buy a sound system to overcome that issue; for now, I just keep volume slightly lower than I&#39;m used to.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	8/22/2015

walmart.com	Reviewing this from a gaming point of view: Bought this primarily for PS3 via HDMI. Needs good amount of adjusting the picture settings (especially the sharpness settings which can greatly effect the quality of the picture, I recommend setting it on the lower end). But after that the picture quality is very good. Ghosting is not a big issue while playing (got it shipped and because of that it was out in the cold, picture was ghosting a lot but only because the lcd was cold after it warmed up ghosting not a big issue). Sound is average. TV has extra capabilities like playing music, photos, etc off a USB drive. Bought it on sale for $209. Great tv for the price. Blu-rays movies also look good on this tv.	5.0	8/4/2015

walmart.com	We just got this t.v. a couple weeks ago and have been really happy with our purchase. It has a good picture, good sound and a great price. Our only dislike is we cannot play videos from our flash drive via the usb but can only play music or view pictures.	5.0	9/8/2015
walmart.com	It is a good TV for the price, but I guess I expected a little more. I&#39;m not very techy, and it took me a while to get the picture the way I wanted it- the color, and sharpness.	5.0	9/8/2015
walmart.com	Well, my summary says it all. We bought this as a step up from the TV we had in our living room. Since we hope to eventually get a huge 3D TV and make this our bedroom TV, we weren&#39;t concerned with having all the bells and whistles. Overall, it was a pleasant surprise. The picture is great and we&#39;ve used it non-stop since it arrived 3 weeks ago with no problems. Our only complaint is that the sound quality on it is horrid...even after adjusting the sound settings. I think with a home surround sound hooked up to it or something it would be fine. There is an option in the menu for turning off the internal speakers and using auxiliary ones, so this shouldn&#39;t be too much of an issue. There is even a headphone jack, so you could probably hook it up to mp3 speakers in a pinch. We just haven&#39;t gotten around to that yet since Dora the Explorer doesn&#39;t really require great sound quality. :-P	5.0	9/10/2015

walmart.com	Not even close to the higher end TVs out there, but we were looking for a cheap TV for my son&#39;s room for XBox and DVDs, and this fit the bill. For the PRICE (we paid under $200), this seems to be a great value. There is a small, faint gray dot in the center of the screen, but it is only noticeable when the screen is fully black. I wouldn&#39;t get this for a main living room TV or if you are a real video fanatic, but for a cheap secondary unit, it works well. Easy to set up.	Menu	9/11/2015

walmart.com	I purchased an off brand tv at another retailer and within a few days the screen went green. this happened twice so i took it back and purchased this TV mostly b/c of pricing. I did not want to spend too much $$ and the reviews for the most part seemed very good. I put a DVD in the first day i set it up and my friend and i where amazed at the picture quality. I have not been home much lately to give a full review on all the features but the screen has turned green on me a few times so i looked it up online and think it has something to do with the manufacturing setting so when it happens i go into settings and reset it and the picture comes back. So far pleased with my purchase	Clear search field	9/13/2015
walmart.com	The TV information packet mentions it doesn&#39;t have a battery and this may impact your setup because it did mine. I almost returned this TV due to thinking it was defective due to the non-responsive state of both the remote and the buttons on the TV while it&#39;s capacitors were charging. The TV will keep shutting itself off (energy star compliance) claiming no input sources and the remote will seem to be non-functional until then. In my case it was also complicated due to the fact the onscreen menu was in French. After the TV &#34;charged&#34; up it then became responsive with an excellent picture and decent speakers. I haven&#39;t tried the USB port on it yet so I don&#39;t know how it would respond as a picture frame nor mp3 player. It has the three hdmi inputs in the back and the other inputs on the side but back of the tv since it&#39;s a tiered depth device. It has a headphone jack back there but no analog rca variable volume output to connect to a stereo unit to use the TV&#39;s remote to control the volume (wanted to connect a subwoofer to it and couldn&#39;t, this may impact your choice of soundbars to connect to it) though it does have a digital audio output. It can also take a 1080p input at 60hz and playback well since we were using a Sony PS3 to play media to it. It&#39;s a good TV at a great price.	Search	9/14/2015

walmart.com	I bought this TV to play my Xbox 360 on, and I absolutely love it, especially for the price. I did not want to spend too much money while not giving up too much quality. I decided to buy another one for my girlfriend for her birthday and she enjoys it as well. That being said, it is only good for the context wpin which we use them. We have small bedrooms, so the sound is great for us in a smaller bedroom. However, in a larger room, as most other reviewers have pointed out, the sound is really not that great. It sounds like it comes from a single speaker in the back of the tv so that even when the sound was turned up all the way, and surround turned on, it didn&#39;t make that much of a difference. Now my biggest problem with this tv, which really irks me: from both TVs I have bought, they both came with a very annoying dead green pixel somewhere on the screen. For mine it is right dead middle of the screen and is very distracting. This has happened to both TVs now and is my biggest problem with this tv.	Items in cart	1/2/2015

I really have no complaints if you are looking for a basic tv with good picture quality and don&#39;t have a clue about refresh rate etc. However, if you plan on using it for over air broadcasting with rabbit ears or some kind of antenna, patience is a must. You&#39;ll spend a fair amount of time getting the antenna in just the right positon to get all the channels, then a few days later, do it again.

Seems obvious I know, but it really needs to be pointed at the TV and not the general vicinity of the TV like most remotes.

walmart.com	over all, I consider this to be a good product. Picture quality is excellent and manuverability in menus is good. Only two things that I would like to see changed. When I turn the unit on, I would prefer to directly to my shows, not have to wait for the company logo to go away, and I still can&#39;t find the wake up time selection. I used my old TV as an alarm clock going directly to the Weather Channel. I now have to rely on an actual clock, even though this unit has a time clock in it.	5.0	11/30/2014

walmart.com	Ordered this T.V. from the website when our Element brand died after 2 years. We just wanted something cheap that would get he job done for now. For $210 I can&#39;t complain. The picture is adequate; sometimes it blurs a bit or has a line for a bit. The sound is much better than I expected. The sound is clear and generally the volume doesn&#39;t have to be too high to hear adequately. I think the sound quality does deteriorate the higher the volume goes up, but I&#39;ve heard that most flat screens have sound issues and that sound bars are generally needed to make them sound good. For a cheap tv it suits my needs just fine. I mainly using it for streaming video and watching DVDs. If you want a tv with amazing picture and features then spend the extra $$$ to get one. Otherwise, it works well enough if your needs are simple.	Toggle Search	11/25/2014
walmart.com	I didn&#39;t expect much from a $200 TV so I was very surprised and happy with the connections with this (eg. 3 HDMI) and the picture quality. You&#39;re still getting what you pay for, but at this price it is more than I feared it would be. Controls are easy, doesn&#39;t look cheap. Remote does feel cheap and sound is kind of hollow, but as a 2nd TV I don&#39;t care.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	12/4/2014
walmart.com	I shopped around for awhile,both online and in store and not just Walmart. I just couldnt justify the big jump in price from 720P to 1080I,so I finally bought the 32inch Sceptor from walmart.com.I ordered it on a monday morning and had it Friday afternoon!! for 229 dollars this is bar far one of the best deals ive found!! pictures great,sound is good,all the good gadget hookups and plenty of adjustments to make every one happy! also the ultra-slim freed up some more cabinet space! all in all a GREAT buy!!

walmart.com	I bought this TV on a hunch...knew nothing about the name or anything. It came very quickly to the store and I am very happy about that. I was shopping at WalMart when the text came that it was in. Upon getting it home, very easy to put together. Only problem that I had with the unit was the remote is garbage. I could not get it to do anything with the tv, replaced the batteries twice and still nothing. Called the number in the manual to find out that the remote has to be programmed to a Sony universal code. I tryed to program it to the code and it would not work. I went back out and bought another universal. This one programmed very easy so the remote that came with the tv is now a great paperweight. Picture is beautiful with an HDMI cable. Would buy it again. Just need to get the remote situation taken better care of.	Clear search field	12/3/2014

The only issue I have with mine is that when you have the TV&#39;s volume up pretty loud and a scream or other high piched noise occures the speaker and base of the TV starts to vibrate a bit, but I fixed that by using a different audio output (like a speaker system or speaker bar). Also another thing I like about this is that the options menu is very easy to access.	5.0	2/5/2015

It&#39;s one real shortcoming is it&#39;s audio output. The unit I have sounds extremely tinny and fuzzes badly with any base added to it so for audio quality I have to give it a big thumbs down. If you can get an inexpensive set of external speakers or if you have a surround sound system to connect it to you&#39;ll not find a better bargain.	4.0	2/10/2015

walmart.com	The one I bought is well worth the money. For the sound I have found that where you position it determines the sound quality. If it is in a corner then sound bounces off walls and you get a weak sound. The picture is no problem and you can change profiles or make your own. For $189.00 dollars it is going to be hard to beat. Yea it is not perfect but it did not cost a $1000.00 either. Not everybody likes the same thing and if they did there would only be one kind of TV any way.

walmart.com	I purchased this item on-line and wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. This has exceeded most of my expectations. The tv has a beautiful picture. The speakers are not the best for music or surround sound and this was my only con. I added a vizio sound bar and what a difference!!!! This tv has 3 hdmi connections, rca composite, and 2 different options for audio out. I think the remote is well balanced and has a solid feel. I have owned this for a few weeks and have been well pleased. I was not looking for 7.1 surround sound from the tv speakers, so it was not and issue. I would purchase this item again and recommend it to my friends.	Search	4/4/2015

walmart.com	We have a Sceptre 46&#34; that we bought a few years ago. The color in 46&#34; is vibrant. The 32&#34; color is bluish and washed out. Still the picture is clear, and considering the cost, it&#39;s an incredible deal. The sound isn&#39;t spectacular, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably even a little better than the 46&#34; Sceptre. So we&#39;re very pleased.	Invalid city, state or zip code	4/6/2015

walmart.com	I&#39;ve had the same TV since I was 7 years old so compared to a 16 yr old Orion television this is definitely an upgrade. A lot of people were commenting on the sound quality, but it&#39;s great. I&#39;ve been told I&#39;m deaf and I have to turn it down so that&#39;s saying something. I don&#39;t have HD but the picture quality is still nice. Probably would be even better with HD. I hooked my Xbox up and love it! Great TV for the price.	5.0	5/24/2015

walmart.com	Honestly for the price I paid for this television, it more than meets expectations. I&#39;m not a techie i any sense at all, I just needed a high def picture for my Wii exercise games :) My only complaint is that it doesn&#39;t keep time correctly. I set the clock and within a few days, it&#39;s off by several minutes. It&#39;s been about a month since I set it again, and it&#39;s running about 3 hours ahead....oh well.

walmart.com	I was a little skeptical buying the tv due to the price and some of the reviews, but so far it is working and looks great. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because even when the volume is turned all the way up it still is not very loud.	5.0	8/1/2015
walmart.com	This TV does the trick for me. I use it in my bedroom and have it connected to an HD receiver and my computer tower. ( I do not use the VGA port as i couldn&#39;t get a picture , I connected it to my computer using a DVI to HDMI cable. ) The picture quality on this TV is good. It&#39;s no top end 1080i picture, so dont expect a flawless picture if you have been spoiled by another. However the 720p picture quality i get from my HD channels is great. It took a little tweaking in the video settings to get the picture where i wanted it, and to be honest it wasn&#39;t good at all with the default settings. Spend some time in the menu system to calibrate the picture to your liking and i&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be disappointed with the end result. My only complaint so far is that the sound quality is a little flat, however with enough tweaking in the settings I did manage to get the sound to a pretty decent level. Overall this is a great TV for the price. You are not going to find many other TVs of this size at this price.	5.0	8/13/2015

walmart.com	For the price you pay for this TV it is a great value. Box shipped Fed EX got here before arrival date. rotating stand could be a bit sturdier but the swivel feature is nice. The batteries for the remote were dead had to replace those, but I was pleasantly surprised that the package came with a screen cleaner and screw driver for assembly of the product. I would however recommend this as a second or sports tv. picture is good as well as sound but viewing movies with a dark back round seems to be a challenge with a contrast ratio of only 3000:1 this is to be expected. Be aware of what you are purchasing and you wont be disappointed.	Menu	10/4/2011

I did have to call the help line to sort out the system for cable TV and had to call more than once. It almost seems as though the help is simply one or two people if that.

walmart.com	I got this on clearance, and I don&#39;t regret it for a single second. The picture quality isn&#39;t the best of the best, but I wasn&#39;t about to spend $500 on a new TV when I could get this for under $200. The sound is fine (I never turn up my TV too loud), and I love that it doubles as a PC monitor. I haven&#39;t checked out all of it&#39;s features, because I&#39;m only really using it for a little bit of TV, console gaming, and a second desktop monitor. So, if you just want a decent sized TV/monitor for your living room or bed room, this is a nice fit. But, again, I got it on clearance. I probably wouldn&#39;t have been as eager if I had paid full price.	5.0	12/17/2011

walmart.com	This is the second Sceptre I bought. The first one is a 46&#34;, second a 32&#34;. Extremely satisfied with these TV&#39;s. , especially seeing that they are dirt cheap. The 46&#34; I have in the living room and added a surround sound system, fabulous for watching movies. The second is in my work studio, could not ask for anything more. The sound is fine for news and regular programs, for movies it is not satisfactory but then neither is the 32&#34; size, that I have my 46&#34; for. Highly recommend this TV for the budget minded person.	5.0	12/27/2011

walmart.com	This TV is basically everything you could ever want for a simple LCD flatscreen. Being a gamer, most of the important TV features to me are picture, sound, and ports. The picture quality is great for the TV, just what you would expect from 720p with an HDMI cable. Xbox 360&#39;s work wonderful with the TV. There is no noticable input lag at all between the controller press and the action that takes place, and this TV has 2ms greater input lag than my previous HDTV. The only reason this didn&#39;t get 5* was because at times, the speakers sound a bit tin-ny, but considering the size of the speakers I suppose that&#39;s to be excepted. They are a fantastic quality though, they just can&#39;t properly create high-pitched sounds (from like orchestral choir, etc.). But this is a minimal issue, as I don&#39;t usually keep the volume past 12 (which is plenty loud enough to hear in a house filled with 4 little kids) and sounds that high usually aren&#39;t common. the other thing are the ports. While there is 2 or 3 (I forget) HDMI slots, there is only one a/v port....which only matters to some people. But as I play older game systems as well, its just a pain to switch it. However, its not something to not buy the TV over. Overall, this is pretty much the best HDTV I&#39;ve owned for the money.	5.0	12/28/2011

walmart.com	Ok, I admit it. I am not an electronics guru. I bought this for my 13 year old as a Christmas gift last year based solely on price. During the summer he played Xbox with his friends nearly every day. There are HDMI ports for easy connection. The sound is good, the picture is good. We did set this TV up in the living room earlier this fall when there were two good football games on at the same time. In the side by side comparison our regular living room TV picture was far superior, then again, it was far more expensive. Honestly, had I never seen the two TV&#39;s together, I wouldn&#39;t have even noticed. I really don&#39;t think this TV can be beat on a combination of features and price. You want more, then pay more. Otherwise, buy this TV. I think you will be happy. I intend to buy a 2nd one for our bedroom.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	12/31/2011

walmart.com	The picture is very clear and was bought at a great price for a basic TV without too many confusing bells and whistles. Don&#39;t consider the 720p versus 1080p/i as a problem as with this size screen I don&#39;t believe the average person could notice the difference. Has a sufficient number of inputs for about anything that may be needed to hook the TV up to including 3 HDMI ports but does not have a ethernet jack or wi-fi for connection to the internet. This TV was bought as a gift for a senior citizen with hearing problems. The sound is very clear and can be adjusted to a high level with no distortion. Has one feature where you can pause the screen temporarily using the enclosed remote that would be helpful if you wanted to review in detail what appears on the screen at a given time (the sound continues to proceed).

walmart.com	The picture quality of this TV is good, but the sound reminds you of a transistor radio. Anyone reading this that is old enough to remember how a transistor radio sounds will remember the &#34;tinny&#34; sound. Like you are in a metal barrel listening to the programs. Could make better use of computer monitor speakers for this system.	5.0	1/17/2012

However, I was glad to see that a majority of options on higher priced TVs were were available on this one. Absolutely recommend this TV if you want a flat screen with HD on a budget. The only complaint that I have is a sometimes touchy remote control.	4.0	1/21/2012

walmart.com	I would of really liked this tv. It was the lowest priced 32&#34; I could find. The only problem was when I received it there was not a stand in the box. I ordered on the Walmart site to store. Well I contacted site to store and they told me it did not come with a stand, but I brought it to their attention that the advertised tv showed a stand and the box said it came with a stand. I could of returned it and waited a week or so to receive a replacement but my local Walmart gave me another tv which cost alot more in trade for the no stand one. Kudos to Walmart of great customer service!	5.0	1/22/2012
walmart.com	An excellent value at the $179 refurbished price I paid. Yes. It does have a tinny sound that I was able to adjust enough to make palatable and not annoying. Must remember this is not a 1080p with 120 or more refresh rate. Even so; it has a very good hi def picture quality in my humble opinion. I would recommend this TV and in fact already have. Is an excellent bedroom or business unit.	5.0	1/24/2012

walmart.com	I honestly believe this is a Sony TV, just masking under another name. This is what they do to get there sales back up then the price of these TV&#39;s will eventually go up. Better get it why it&#39;s hot. Excellent TV and you absolutely can&#39;t beat the price. When I went to program my remote, it says follow the Sony settings, a very good indication that my beliefs are dead on..	5.0	1/24/2012
walmart.com	Nice set. Only one complaint. There needs to be more room around the coax connector and VGA port.	5.0	1/25/2012
walmart.com	My ancient Sony set blew up, and I ordered this on-line that night. It was delivered to my home 3 days later, set it up in 15-20 minutes and I was happily watching TV that night. The sound quality is fairly mediocre but the picture is quite good...though you need to fine tune it to your preferences. This set allows you to fine tune just about everything ( sound, picture, aspect etc) and it&#39;s easy to figure out, even if you aren&#39;t very electronic savvy, which is really nice, because I&#39;m not. I&#39;ll be adding a sound bar to improve the volume and sound quality, and you do have to buy a HDMI cable ( $14.00) if you have DirecTv, but for the money I paid for it ( $198.00) this set far exceeds expectations. I got the extended warranty just in case, since some reviewers had fatal function problems right away, but so far I&#39;m pleased with this whole deal. And this review site is what made me look at this relatively unknown brand in the first place...very helpful My only regret is that I didn&#39;t have the extra $100.00 to get the 42 inch model with 1080p (-:	5.0	1/25/2012

walmart.com	I purchased this television to replace one that was stolen. I purchased it during cyber week and I think it is a great deal for the price I paid. I had never heard of the brand Sceptre before and I&#39;m pretty impressed with it. The picture seems to be a little dull to me, but that may be due to having a digital converter and not cable hooked up straight to it. The setup for the TV was very simple and I like that it came with its own screwdriver and cloth to wipe the screen. I would definitely recommend this television if you are looking for something simple with not a lot of bells and whistles.	5.0	1/28/2012

Sleep timer requires you to push two buttons at the same time, which is sorta weird. Haven&#39;t played with many of the features yet.

walmart.com	We needed to replace our 2 year old flat screen that cost way more but we didn&#39;t get the service plan (or I couldn&#39;t find it anyways). Lesson learned there. This TV is 6 inches bigger for $100 less so we could afford a 4 year service plan. Size is perfect, set up is easy but takes a while to go thru the channels so be patient. Works with our cable box, DVD/VCR and Wii just like the old one. Picture is pretty good....seemed a bit dark at first compared to old TV, so I brightened it with the controls. Works with old Universal remote. Use Sony code as others have commented in the questions section. Sound is from the back so it sounds a bit muffled, which is the only thing I don&#39;t really like, but since this is for the kids play room, I can live with it for sure. I would hestitate to buy the same one for our bedroom or main living room because of the sound quality.	5.0	2/21/2012

On occasion I do hear a hum when no signal is present (before I go to the tuner or other active signal like DVD), but that is only when there is no signal so not that big of a deal. I ordered online for $180 and free shipping. Delivered to my door 3 days later. Overall very pleased for the price. If looking for quality video on a budget, this is a winner.	5.0	2/23/2012

walmart.com	The only reason I marked this as a 3 of 5 on meeting my expectations is because I&#39;m in Afghanistan, which doesn&#39;t use digital air waves so I needed an analog tuner. I saw this TV for $188 and jumped all over it. However, it has an NTSC analog tuner, which only works in the US (ironically, where there are no more analog broadcasts). Here they use the PAL standard, with which this TV is not compatible. I still recommend this TV based on value, picture, and sound quality. Just don&#39;t make the mistake I made if you live outside the US and think it will work without an external PAL converter box or DVD player with a built-in NTSC/PAL tuner.	4.0	3/10/2012

walmart.com	I bought this to replace an old analog TV that died. I knew I was taking a risk due to the price, but I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised. I&#39;ve had the TV for about a week now. It worked fine for a couple of days, but then the picture started showing interference. It had wide, horizontal bands of white &#34;snow&#34; in large flickering pixels. Over the next couple of days it got progressively worse to the point of being impossible to watch. I had seen a couple of reviews where the TV worked fine for a couple of days and then just stopped working, so I was worried I was going to have to return it and pay for a more expensive one, but I thought I&#39;d try replacing the co-axle cable first. I was using the one from the previous TV. I replaced the cable this evening and so far, so good. The picture is now clear with zero interference. Finger&#39;s crossed this will last. I&#39;ll update if I have problems. I do not have HD cable on this TV, so I can&#39;t really assess the picture quality. My mother says it isn&#39;t as crisp as her TVs where HD cable is connected, but it seems to be pretty good to me. As for the sound, it is loud enough and I do not hear any interference. I don&#39;t claim to have very sensitive hearing these days, however. I don&#39;t find there is a lot of control over the settings. They seem pretty limited. I think I went through them all as I was trying to clean up the picture as it declined. Overall, I&#39;m happy with my purchase. For $200, I got a 32&#34; flat screen. It is not a fine television by any standards, but it is certainly good enough for me. I&#39;m realistic enough to know that in a month, I could be singing a different tune, but for now, I&#39;d recommend this to others. If you are strapped for cash but you really want a flat screen, this is the TV for you. Or, if you need an extra TV for a guest room, etc., this TV will do fine.	5.0	3/21/2012

walmart.com	The only reason that I didn&#39;t give this tv five stars- a few months ago, I bought a 40 inch tv for the same price. It was the same brand, LCD- 1080p. I don&#39;t know why the prices have gotten jacked up- but- this is a great tv. The picture is crystal clear, unless you&#39;re sitting 2 ft. away or closer, then you do see some jagged areas. As far as the sound goes, there are actually settings that you can change in the menus on the 40 inch- not sure if this one has it or not, as it was a gift for my sister. I assume they most likely have the same settings though. If you go and read the reviews for the 40 inch, you will find a very helpful review of how to set up the sound quality settings for the best performance. As far as expectations, I wasn&#39;t expecting such a crisp picture, so that was great. Also, the weight of the tv- very light. Great tv!	Toggle Search	4/7/2012
walmart.com	I have had this for about 2 weeks. The remote is kind of an old design and the remote is very directional. The tuner is good with an amplified antenna I get about 20 digital stations in my urban area of St Louis. The sound is kind of tinny, it can be tweaked, but depending on the source it&#39;s loud and I&#39;ve had difficulty turning it down enough in the bedroom to be courtesy low. The picture can be dark depending on the movie but it&#39;s got me to be cable free with my Roku, Netflix and Hulu Plus in 720p in HD. Very pleased overall with the purchase. I got the extended warranty (which I usually never do) since the TV is cheap and $20 for 3 years is reasonably priced.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	4/7/2012

walmart.com	The picture is fairly poor(grainy and pixelated) but I don&#39;t have an HD box through DirecTV. It looks amazing with my PS3 with my HDMI cable. I just don&#39;t have the money to pay for an HD receiver and the picture quality isn&#39;t good with normal feed. Overall a great purchase for the price though!	Clear search field	4/12/2012
walmart.com	TV was easy to set up came with everything right down to the screwdriver.I very happy with my purchase and the price was great. The only thing I wish was that the base was taller that you could let it up I had to set it up on a box so it wouldn&#39;t be so low. All things aside its a great value and product.	Search	4/15/2012
walmart.com	I was impressed with the picture quality of this tv. I only have it hooked up to basic cable and not HD but the picture is still great! The only thing I was a little dissapointed with was that the remote doesn&#39;t seem to have a button to toggle between channels or go back to the last channel. Perhaps I just haven&#39;t figured out where it is yet.....	Items in cart	4/20/2012
walmart.com	Great Product for the money. The only downside is that the Audio out is not controlled by the tv volume. so you have to have volume control on your external speaker system.	Enter city, state or zip code	4/23/2012

walmart.com	This TV was bought to replace a very large CRT model. My hearing is going, badly, and, as well, I wanted something more up to date so I could use wireless headphones and not shake the walls of the house nor break the others&#39; ears if they were interested in watching the same show as I. This is last year&#39;s model and as such was available very inexpensively - 189 plus 10 shipping the monster, almost-30 pound package to my home in 2 days (standard shipping was only 5), which I consider impossible, given that I had to pay UPS 10 to ship a 6# item 30 miles recently - but, nonetheless, an outstanding bargain. The colors vary from source to source. The top news stations have the best color rendition and sound quality, but the movie channels and other minor cable channels have very irregular sound and color. I presume that to be a factor of production values, and not the set, but nonetheless, it was irritating by comparison to the CRT. The set has all the last-year&#39;s whizbangs, which means that I can stick a USB memory into the side of the unit and have a huge slide show of my pictures, or my videos. I&#39;ve not tried any of the other ports other than the earphone; it cuts the sound as would be expected - but I&#39;ll not be using a wired headset, anyway, so it doesn&#39;t matter. Unfortunately, my wireless headset hasn&#39;t yet arrived, so I can&#39;t actually comment on that function (RCA outputs), but I expect that it will be just fine. Overall, a great value.	5.0	4/30/2012

I didn&#39;t have a lot of money and spent a long time online looking for something i could afford. This was the cheapest 32&#34; I could find and it is ideal. The picture quality is good and it has all the features I needed, enough ports to connect the blu-ray, wii, etc. The sound isn&#39;t fantastic but more than enough to hear comfortably, it tends to be quieter when watching tv but louder when playing games or watching movies for some reason. All in all I would definitely reccomend this TV.	5.0	5/21/2012

walmart.com	I own and older model of this set and it worked great for many years. Then it started to take longer and longer to come on. The last time I turn it off it took 4 hours to come on, so i hooked it up to my sercurity system and it works fine and comes right on. Now for the new one sometimes i have to turn on and I get sound only and have then turn it off and then turn it back on and it works fine. So if little things like turning it on and off bother you, you should buy another brand. I am still fine tuning the picture to my liking and the sound is much better now that I moved it off the default setting. I purchased the 3 years warranty with this one so I am not looking to buy another soon.	5.0	6/8/2012

walmart.com	This is my second Sceptre TV. (I also own the next larger size.) Consumer Reports says the most important TV feature you should spend money on is its size. None of the other features comes close. So, both times we looked for the biggest TV for the money &amp; ended up with Sceptres each time. I&#39;ve had the first for a year &amp; it&#39;s great for the money. Ditto the second. I would almost say I don&#39;t know why anyone spends more except the sound quality of both Sceptres is really mediocre.

Mark threw me a gift card with the refunded price and then some. That proves:to talk to the man in charge&#34;. I didn&#39;t leave with a new tv, but I DID LEAVE HAPPY! I love my Walmart!

walmart.com	I recently purchased this TV, I was a little hesitant as I&#39;ve never heard as a Sceptre. Well this TV is great especially for the money, I purchased mine for $259.00 and it&#39;s excellent in my bedroom.The speakers aren&#39;t that great so I hooked up the TV to my sound system with external speakers and that took care of that problem. As I read through the guide book it says that this TV can be used with a sony remote so I presume it&#39;s made by sony. I liked this TV so much that I went out and purchased a 40 inch for my living room.I would recommend a Sceptre to to anyone. I forgot to mention that the picture on the TV is fantastic.	5.0	8/19/2012

walmart.com	I bought this TV for a bedroom and hooked it up to an antenna. I get great reception and a great picture. The TV stand was easy to attach to the TV and I had it assembled in just a couple of minutes. They even include a Phillips screwdriver in the box. The TV is attractive with a narrow case showing from the front. The sound is average with the sound coming from the bottom of the set instead of the front. There is plenty of volume to hear the sound over my treadmill running. I like the fact that this TV is lightweight and easy to move around. The plug to attach either cable or antenna faces downward. There is a separate area facing the left (looking from the front) with additional hookups, such as (1) USB and (3) HD, but not a place to attach cable or antenna there. I found this a little inconvenient, but it is a minor issue. Scanning for channels during set-up was easy using the quick set-up guide provided. I also tried hooking the TV to cable in another room and had good success with that too. The picture quality is very good for the price I paid. Overall I&#39;m very pleased with this TV in the 3 days I&#39;ve had it. I have watched it each day as I&#39;m on my treadmill. The remote is easy to use and batteries and a polish cloth were included in the package. I ordered this TV on a Friday morning, and it was delivered FedEx by the following Monday. Shipping was fast, and the package arrived in good condition. Walmart sent a timely shipping notification to me by email and I was able to track the package along the way. Great job Walmart and FedEx!	5.0	11/26/2012

walmart.com	I bought mine on line, on Black Friday. Used it for a week, and works well. I have my TV hooked up to a Verizon FiOS box, and to a Chromecast (since the TV has a USB port, I use that to power the Chromecast). Overall I am happy with the picture. I was worried about the 60HZ refresh rate, especially with fast moving video (like a sporting event), but have not seen any issues. The only draw back would be the sound. It plays well since my TV is in a cabinet and reflects the sound back to me. However it if was wall mounted, I would imagine you would need a sound bar. Summary: For the price (169.00) and free shipping it was a good purchase.	5.0	12/1/2012

It makes you search for the digital cable channels and I had to go through the set up a couple of times before I could actually watch TV (It could have been an oversight on my part). Once I got it set up everything appears to be gook. The picture quality is good, then again I am not a real stickler about that as long as its clear. However, I am still working on increasing the sound. It&#39;s a little low for my taste (hope I&#39;m not losing my hearing!) even with the volume all the way up. I didn&#39;t go into the menu and see if it was on stereo or not. I will check that and post again if that&#39;s the problem.

The only complaint is the speakers are a little tinny sounding, but not as bad as other Tv&#39;s I&#39;ve seen. Overall, this is a great tv, especially for $179. I added a google chromecast and it works great. The only complaint is with content providers not having apps for Direct tv. Also, to use the cast function from a browser, it has to be on a laptop, and not from android tablet.	5.0	8/30/2013

walmart.com	I have purchased three of this particular model tv, the first 2 years ago at $249 so at Walmart&#39;s current price it is a real bargain. I have had no problems with any of the tv, they all worked fine right out of the box. I must point out that you are buying a 720p tv and you get a picture as good as you can possibly get with this technology which more then meets my needs, however it is not a 1080p tv.	5.0	8/30/2013

I contacted support about the volume problem and there suggestion to solve this problem was for us to make an additional purchase of a sound bar to fix the low volume problem. The TV has been working fine other than the low volume problem. If you have young ears this is a great buy for this TV.	5.0	9/7/2013

walmart.com	I own 3 Sceptres. Never mind the 720P . Most people cannot tell the difference to 1080P I can&#39;t (I have both). BE SURE to get LED backlighting. That is the feature that separates the men from the boys. Much sharper picture. Sure the sound is not very good. Get a pair of USB powered speakers ( I got Altec Lansing )Nough said. Cost $14. Found out the plug in power source speakers have feedback--not pleasant. I have had my first 32&#34; set for 2 years---GREAT. My next 2 are 1 year and 2 months respectively. Most failures are within the first few weeks or months and you can take the set back. Sceptre is inexpensive and American. If they fail in a year or two, big deal. How much did you pay for the predecessor--$599 for a 27&#34; like me??? That&#39;s it I am well pleased.	5.0	10/30/2013

walmart.com	Arrived 5 days earlier than promised with free shipping. Easy to set up, even came with a magnetized screwdriver for assembly which is needed for 6 small screws for mounting the base. I am mainly using as a PC monitor. Good picture as TV or monitor. Less expensive than a lot of 24&#34; or smaller TV &#39;s. If you are planning to use with a PC you will need either a VGA or an HDMI connection cable not included. Easy to switch between TV and monitor with included remote.

walmart.com	Purchased this TV for use in bedroom. The price was very attractive. At 720 resolution, I was a bit skeptical that the quality would be good but was pleasantly surprised when I got it hooked up and started using it. The picture is very very good - sharp, no distortion. The speakers are on the low end and sound a bit &#34;tinny&#34; but for a bedroom TV, the sound is acceptable. No problems with setting up and getting it up and running. I will likely purchase another one for another spare room. It&#39;s only been in use for about 30 days, so I cannot comment on longevity, but it looks like a very good buy at least at this point.	5.0	2/24/2014
walmart.com	This TV looks good, was easy to set up, has plenty of connection options, and has good picture quality, but seems to have volume issues. We purchased this for the bedroom, and use it with a Roku box (NetFlix, Hulu, etc.). However, with the volume maxed at 100%, we still struggle to hear dialog at 8 feet away. The older TV we replaced with this model had no such issues, and we usually didn&#39;t have to go over 35% volume with that TV. We&#39;ll probably have to spend upwards of $100.00 on an external speaker system, which we don&#39;t really have room for, and could have just added that expense to the original TV cost and purchased a better model. Overall, we&#39;re happy with the TV for the price, but the volume issue will cost extra to resolve...	5.0	2/24/2014

walmart.com	Picture&#39;s good, size is perfect for our bedroom, and we love it. The only thing that we are not 100% satisfied with is the sound. It is not the best, and sounds like everyone is talking in a cave, but just slightly. Obviously not so bad that we don&#39;t enjoy movies. For the price, it&#39;s perfect!	5.0	3/13/2014

walmart.com	I purchased this TV for my daughters dorm after the holidays. I was concerned about the brand, I never heard of it before. I did some research and found some of the parts are Sony brand. This was a positive aspect including the price. I read many of the customer reviews, the good and bad, decided for the price and the reason it was needed we should give it a try. It came with a small stand which had to placed on the TV. The screw driver was included, thankfully as we did not have one in her dorm room. The remote also came with batteries, forgot those too. The instructions were easy to follow and we were watching TV in about 10 minutes after the channels loaded. The picture clarity is not bad for something so inexpensive, and the first this we watched was football. I did not use it enough to say yes I would consider for my primary TV, but my daughter is enjoying a 32 inch in her dorm and she said it is great! I would recommend this product and will buy another in the future.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	3/24/2014

walmart.com	I bought this refurb needing best price for good TV. I had no hesitation with this relatively obscure brand because several years ago I bought a used PC that came with a Sceptre wide-screen monitor with DVI input and internal speakers which has been used constantly and still works flawlessly with incredible clarity and contrast. This Sceptre TV&#39;s picture is just as good, and I was pleased when, despite being a refurbished unit, Sceptre allowed me to register the purchase and extended the full factory warranty. I was, however, slightly disappointed with its less than full-feature control set, for example its USB input will only show pictures or play music; video files of any format not even detected (boo!). I mean, why even have a USB port? Its seemingly comprehensive remote control includes many buttons (1/3 of total) which are unassigned any function and cannot be used (boo!) Not even the buttons designated to control a SoundBar will function with a Sceptre (or any other) Soundbar. Finally, it is NOT a SmartTV, which I realized and I hope to connect a USB Chrome/Amazon/Roku or other stick so that Internet and WiFi streaming will become possible.	5.0	4/10/2014

walmart.com	Excellent picture, size. USB port however is not friendly to Mac Users. Drives have to be formatted as Windows FAT 32, not Mac Format. And while Mac can format drives as Windows FAT 32, it creates hidden files which the Sceptre Tv tries to read and then lists as &#34;cannot display.&#34; There is a work around, but it is quite tedious. You have to find the hidden files using Terminal, then delete them in terminal. Google for directions.	5.0	8/1/2014

A little gray at the extreme corners of the picture, the clock doesn&#39;t keep accurate time, it turns itself off after 10 minutes (it&#39;s suppose to) but it doesn&#39;t turn itself back on when the computer is turned on or brought out of screensaver; nevertheless, it was a good purchase!

Its got all the features from HDMI to USB input to VGA, which means you could watch moves straight from your Flash drive or connect your laptop to the TV using a VGA cable and you could use it as a big screen and watch things of the net. The sound is somewhat low and needs a higher volume, however if use a Sceptre Soundbar that problem is taken care off and you can also use your TV remote for the soundbar as it is incorporated in the TV remote.

After a couple days, the picture would start flickering and flashing on and off after being on for about 15 minutes and then it would be fine after that. I decided to return it and I&#39;m trying out the LED version of Sceptre because it had better reviews although it was about $30 more. Hopefully this one works better.

walmart.com	I connected this set via an HDMI cable from my satellite system. The picture was great, and the sound was adequate, when it worked. After watching for about 30-40 minutes, the sound was just cut off. If you turn the set off and then on again, the sound would return, for another 30-40 minutes. The phone call to Tech Support was a joke. The technician (same guy, 2 days in a row) suggested I use the component connection, and my Dish box does not have component outputs, so he suggested I try the AV outputs. This seemed to resolve the sound problem, along with a loss in picture quality using a single video plug versus the HDMI connection. That solution was completely unsatisfactory for a TV less than 2 weeks old. If you can get a set that works, it was well worth the price, but I was unwilling to continue to take chances with trying a replacement set. I exchanged it at Wal-Mart for a slightly pricier, but more dependable set.	5.0	11/28/2014

The sound quality is not that great and the television vibrates audibly on low end (bass) tones in the sound. If you are hooking it up to a stereo system (and external speakers) for your audio, this won&#39;t be an issue since the sound won&#39;t be coming from the TV. For me, the sound problem takes my overall rating from 4 stars to 3.	5.0	12/11/2014

I have to the remote placed at the right spot towards the tv in order for it to anything.

I figured oh I am sure it is fine. The tv really does not get very loud though. I am now looking into purchasing a sound bar system to go with it even though it is only for a bedroom.

walmart.com	I needed new TV, and with plans to use this TV in a living room within the next year, I figured, why not buy this one? The deal was fantastic for Black Friday. The stand on the TV is wobbly. Luckily my TV isn&#39;t placed in an area of high traffic, nor is it anywhere someone could knock it, but it makes me a little wary. The sound is... interesting. It&#39;s a loud TV. With the volume as low as it possibly can be, I can sit down and hear the TV perfectly. Great for some, not great if you&#39;re using this TV to fall asleep to. Also, the sound is a little &#34;tinny&#34; to me... it has that tin-can echo. Like someone else mentioned, I fiddled around with the general sound settings and EQ, but it can get a little annoying to do over and over. It does have a fair amount of options for picture and sound, but less than what I&#39;d gotten on my old 22&#34; Emerson TV. So far, I&#39;m not too impressed with the picture, but I&#39;m not watching any HD channels, and I haven&#39;t watched a blu-ray on it yet. So, for basic cable, it&#39;s just... you know, big. So, for the price, it&#39;s definitely worth it, and I&#39;m grateful for that. Is the TV exceptional? No, it definitely suffers a bit from the &#34;bigger is better&#34; problem plaguing technology right now.	5.0	12/23/2014
walmart.com	I purchased (2) 32&#34; Sceptre Flat Screen TV&#39;s on 11.28.2012... The picture quality is awesome... especially because of the poor vision that both my husband &amp; I have. The only thing that I am disappointed in is the sound.. the volume quality. It definitely was not what I expected. I turned the volume all the way up and for me, it seemed low. I called the mfg. and they told me that I needed to purchase a &#34;Sound Bar&#34; from any electronics company. I called Best Buy and they told me that the &#34;Sound Bar&#34; cost anywhere from $149 to $500. You know my mouth was hanging open! Maybe sometime next year I will be able to purchase a &#34;Sound Bar&#34; but that&#39;s still disappointing to me.	5.0	12/24/2014

walmart.com	The Shipping was Excellant...Very Fast Good Service. The picture is basically ok.. Crisp and Clear. The Sound is Great. I&#39;ve only had it about two weeks now, but everything seems to work as it should. The only weekness I see is that the color could be improved upon, and a smaller remote couldn&#39;t hurt. It&#39;s not that the color is horrible, it&#39;s that tv&#39;s I have had in the past compensated better the color from one channel to the next. With this one, at least in my opinion, changing from one channel to another, the color intensity is not uniform. Other than that, I think it&#39;s a very nice tv, at a good price..	Menu	12/24/2014
walmart.com	Still like the television, unfortunately mine has started to act up! Some days you have to turn on and off the remote 4 to 5 times or more, just to get the television to come on. Now today the picture has started to go in and out while playing. Contacted Walmart since I had bought the extended warranty. good thing I bought it, since I originally purchased 11/04/2011. Now the bad news, under the warranty, they are sending me a shipping label, and I have to mail back in the original box( yes I kept mine) make sure you keep yours, it is part of the warranty. Now I will be without a television for 5 - 10 days. I think that at this price, they should just send you a new television to the store, and have you bring the broken televison in for exchange. Oh well, will see how the warranty people work on getting it back. May make me think about purchasing another televsion. When you are on disability, it is difficult to come up with an extra $200 for a tv.	Toggle Search	12/25/2014

walmart.com	We were so excited to get a TV for the price. The big issue is the picture quality is poor and no matter what adjustments I make it seems out of focus and the color isn&#39;t brilliant. Looks faded. Also I cannot seem to hook up our DVD player no matter what cables I put in which RCA slots. So this has been frustrating at this point. I was excited when I read about the manufacturer and their development history, but now I don&#39;t know if I will buy another product from this vendor.

walmart.com	The unit&#39;s maximum sound volume is lower than expected. Connecting my HD Player via the HDMI connector presented &#39;no sound&#39; issue. Switching to the VCR connector presented additional sound issues - the VCR connection shares the sound connectors with the YPbPr connector [which is connecting my VCR/DVD player] causing me to have to &#39;physically&#39; switch cables between them to have sound.

I had to contact Sceptre and they had me fill out an RMA request form via their website and wait 72 hours.

walmart.com	We bought this online and picked it up at the store. Upon getting home it set up easily and looked great (a big improvement over our old tube tv) :). Unfortunately, within about 10 minutes the screen suddenly went black. We could hear the sound and change channels, but no picture. I called tech services and they said it was a motherboard issue and would need repair or replacing. Since I just bought it, they recommended returning it to the store and getting a new one. We took it back with no problem but the same model was out of stock to reorder so we ordered the higher pixel version of Sceptre. We have had no problems with the new one. So, in summary, unless you get a dud (reviews indicate the black screen is the most common problem but doesn&#39;t happen often), this is a good value for the money.	5.0	12/31/2014

Overall it is a good set for the money and it works very well. the stand it sets on is too light and flimsy, could easily fall over if rocked too much.

They state there is a 24 to 48hrs turnaround time for someone to reach out; however, it is going a week with no contact from Sceptre reps.

Started having issues with the monitor turning off and on after 1st year, would have to try several times To turn the power on via remote or manually at least once a week. Now, 1 year and 10 months after purchase the display/monitor is completely kaput! Just went bad one day with Flickers and flashes on the screen. Did not purchase warranty. Friend of mine bought exact same model from different retailer and same happened to hers after about 1 1/2 years.

walmart.com	I think this a good buy when you are on a budget and aren&#39;t a electronic buff. My only complaint is that the sound quality is pretty bad. Especially when you have it on twenty and you can still barely hear. This comes from a girl who hates when my other TV is on anything above 8. Otherwise it is a good buy. I would recommend a sound bar.	Search	1/27/2015
walmart.com	I thought this would be an inexpensive TV to fit our needs but ended up returning it for two reasons... #1 Sound was way too quite. I used it while running on my treadmill and couldn&#39;t hear the TV even with the volume all the way up. #2 There was a big vertical line all the way through the TV that would not go away. Set up was easy and Walmart let me return it for a full refund. I probably could have exchanged it for another TV that would not have had the line through it, but would still have been disappointed with the lack of volume.	Items in cart	1/28/2015

walmart.com	This has been a good tv for the several weeks I&#39;ve had it and if you&#39;re concerned about buying a 720p rather than a 1080p you really can&#39;t tell the difference on a 32&#34;. I bought the tv because I needed something affordable and I am pleased with my purchase. The only downfall (as with any cheap tv) is the sound quality. To be completely honest it sucks. I bought a set of Bose speakers to compensate and you would never know I got it all for under $200. Pros: Good value, Easy setup, Good picture quality (with some minor adjustments) Cons: Horrible sound quality, The ugly &#34;LED TV&#34; sticker in the top left corner In summary I am pleased with my purchase so far and would recommend it to a friend along with a set of speakers	5.0	2/1/2015
walmart.com	I personally have a smaller one of these. They are fine for what you pay but sound is a bit &#34;tinny.&#34; One thing to note is that the speakers face somewhat downward so it is better if attached to the wall as opposed to sitting on a stand, as speakers will sound &#34;muffled.&#34;	5.0	2/1/2015

walmart.com	My kids got me this TV for Christmas. I was very excited and loved everything about it. After a week, I had a problem with the sound. There was no audio. I called DirectTV not knowing if it was an issue with the remote and a button being indivertibly pushed. The only thing that got the sound back was to unplug the TV. However, after a short amount of time (minutes) the audio would go off again. We have to take the TV back and get a new one. Of course this is a pain because we had to plug the old TV back in and take the TV back and redo the whole process again. So not really happy with this part. But when the TV worked, I loved it.	5.0	2/15/2015

Sometimes not at all for 2-3 days, other times 1-2 times a day. Since it was easy to program the Direct TV remote to work the TV, when it switches it&#39;s self to HDMI 2 I have to find the TV remote to switch it back (then rewind to where it switched off). Would be very annoying if I couldn&#39;t rewind. HDMI 1 is the only connection used in my setup and remote is put away to eliminate an accidental switch.	Toggle Search	6/7/2015

walmart.com	Got this for a family Christmas present to replace an old Sceptre (that we loved but had begun having issues), and had to take it back. The price was great and Walmart.com site to store shipping was pretty quick but the box was a little dented around the edges. When we plugged it in at home we had issues with the sound quality, everything sounded tinny and the TV would vibrate with certain frequencies (maybe this is because the speakers come out of the bottom?). This seems to be a problem with many of the new slim flat-screen LCD&#39;s though, so it&#39;s hard to say if it was damaged or just of poor quality. The picture quality was good, no complaints about that. After the first use, the TV also began making a &#34;clunking&#34; noise when we would turn it on or off. Sorry Sceptre, but you&#39;ve lost a customer until you work out your sound issues :(	5.0	6/26/2015
walmart.com	I purchased this TV due to the great reviews I read however, when we got it home, I was disappointed.

walmart.com	First of all, I have this tv only one week. While the sound is good, the picture quality is realllllllllllllllllllllly bad. It’s fuzzy and I couldn’t fix it no matter how many adjustments I made. My 7 years Apex tv (which was an old school btw) had a better picture quality than this. I’m VERY disappointed and now I can’t even watch my favorite tv shows because this tv gives me a headache. The reason I bought it is because of the price since my budget is very tight and most of the reviews where nice, which was misleading obviously. So, if you really want a tv that offers good quality picture &amp; sound, then I guess you must be willing to pay a little more. That is exactly what I am going to do; take this tv back to the store and exchange it with better one, like Sony/Samsung or even Vizio.	5.0	7/7/2015

walmart.com	All in all the TV was just ok. I called Scepter to get some technical support because from the time I plugged in the TV there was &#34;snow&#34; on the screen, and nothing I did would get rid of it. When I called them I couldn&#39;t even talk to a live person, the only option I was given was to leave a message; so that&#39;s what I did. A week went by with no return call, so I called and left another message this time providing my work number in addition to my home number. I never heard back from them. Frankly it was mostly the lack of customer support to help me work through the problems that I got fed up with; I ended up returning the TV.	5.0	7/17/2015

walmart.com	This was my first online order through Walmart.com. I also used site to store pick up which both of these experiences were good. BUT once we got the TV home and opened the box to set TV up very important parts were missing...power cord, remote, swivel base to attach tv to the base and any manuals. We tried to call their 1-800 number and were on hold going through prompts, then chose to log in to their online customer service. After explaining what was missing they promised to ship them the next day. We received them in good time. While setting the tv up we found that the power cord is very tight and had trouble getting it to turn on. After working with it for a bit was able to get the television to power up. We are happy with the television once we got past the original problems.	5.0	8/26/2015
walmart.com	Purchased this mainly for use with my game console. Set up was pretty easy and the TV came with a miniature screw driver. I was a little bothered by the stand though, as the TV would wobble a good deal when touched (and yes, I made sure the screws on the mount were tightened). It was great until I started playing a darker-themed game, and I noticed a few dozen pixels were dead. I thought it was a scratch at first, until I looked closer, and after noticing it, I just could not look past it. Sound was great -- in fact, I tend to like my volume low, and had to keep it at a 1 so I didn&#39;t feel like I was blasting out my neighbors. Aside from the pixel issue, the picture was pretty good, but I just couldn&#39;t stand the defect. I brought it back to my store the following day with the intention of purchasing another, until a customer told me she&#39;d purchased the same exact TV. She told me she&#39;d actually purchased two for use in her restaurant (only open for four hours at a time), and both TV&#39;s stopped working within 2-3 months of the purchase date. After hearing that, I decided against trying again.	5.0	8/27/2015

walmart.com	Due to the low price, I purchased this TV for my home office and am very disappointed. I knew that if I bought an off-brand there would some sort of trade-off. A few years ago, I bought a 42&#34; Insignia for my living room and am very pleased with it, so I assumed this TV would be of that quality. Not so. The sound quality is very&#39; tinny&#39; and the picture, well - its darkish, not bright and colorful and no matter what I do to adjust it, I cannot fix either. If you don&#39;t really care about picture &amp; sound quality and want cheap - buy this TV. But for a few dollars more, you can get a top brand TV with sound and picture to go with it.	5.0	9/5/2015
walmart.com	This TV is, first of all, incredibly well priced – that is an undeniable fact. However, I bought it 5/5/12, and 5 days ago on 3/28/13, it died; did not quite make it to a year. I do still have audio, but no picture at all, no manufacturer&#39;s graphic overlay (e.g., guide, menu, settings), nothing. I turned it on and there was a &#34;pop&#34; and then nothing but sound. I would not recommend it, and I am sincerely hoping that the manufacturer&#39;s 1-year warranty is actually useable. I have purchased a 32” Phillips to replace it, hopefully I will have better luck with this unit – but bought the 3-year warranty just in case :P	5.0	9/5/2015
walmart.com	Sound isn&#39;t too good. I had to turn it up high to hear it and the tv vibrates because of it. The stand isn&#39;t stable so the tv wobbles. The only nice thing about it i can say is the picture is good. The tv blew out 8 months after i got it. If you still wanna risk it get the warranty on it when it breaks down but who wants to go though that. Don&#39;t believe those good comments on this page because i did and look what happened.	5.0	9/7/2015
walmart.com	I bought this TV late November 2012 and the picture lasted 7 months and died! I tried to get a Return Authorization from the Sceptre website and it doesn&#39;t even work. Don&#39;t buy this TV no matter how cheap the offer it. You will regret your purchase.	5.0	9/8/2015
walmart.com	I bought the TV, it worked well for 11 month1 week (under warranty) then the picture flickered out and in. Trying to contact Sceptre by phone, your almost out of luck, email will take a few days if your lucky also, they replaced it, I received it back after 2 weeks 3 days, opened it, and turned it on and found that the screen was broke, so... had to repeat trying to contact them, and I guess it&#39;s in the mail. Bottom line... the customer service is less than sub standard in my book	5.0	9/9/2015

walmart.com	I purchased my TV November 2012. I have had it 13 months and it has already quit working. I have no sound or picture. The TV light turns blue to indicate the TV is ON and when I try to shut the TV OFF it doesn&#39;t shut off the TV with the remote or by using the Power button. I have to unplug the TV to get it to turn off. I have a friend whose TV only lasted 4 months. His was still under warranty but he lived in Virginia at the time and it was quite a bit of money to return to California so he just purchased another brand of TV. If you Google Sceptre televisions you will be able to read some other horror stories about this TV.	5.0	9/17/2015
walmart.com	Everything about this TV seemed great but it only lasted 10 months. The TV won&#39;t power up, When you turn it on both blue lights appear but no picture so basically my $180 bargain only lasted me 10 months......I certianly didn&#39;t expect it to last forever, but expected it to at last at least a couple of years.	5.0	9/18/2015
walmart.com	This TV is mediocre but the price is great. I ordered it online and had it shipped to the store. I picked it up yesterday and I&#39;m returning it today. As soon as I attached it to the stand and turned it on, the first thing I noticed was that there was a small green dot that was compromising the video quality of the screen. So one of the pixels was not generating a picture. It becomes more evident if the screen fades to black or if you&#39;re watching a nighttime or low lit scene in a movie or TV show. This doesn&#39;t help the fact that the video quality is already less than stellar in the first place. The picture appears grainy and it looks like you&#39;re viewing an analog channel on a digital TV. The next problem is the sound quality. When the sound is on and a show is playing, there doesn&#39;t appear to be any problems with the sound. If you&#39;re using a DVR and you pause the playback, eventually the TV makes a repetitive scratching sound. I went up to the TV to make sure that&#39;s where the sound was coming from and I put my hand on the back of it. I could feel the vibration coinciding with the noise that was coming from the TV while the DVR was paused. Then after it went on for a while, it started getting louder! This was all within two hours of taking it out of the box. You really get what you pay for, I&#39;m going to exchange it for a better TV and pay a little extra like I should have in the first place.	5.0	9/22/2015
walmart.com	I got this TV November 2012 and it was great at first, that&#39;s why I rated it two stars instead of 1. In October 2013, the screen stopped working and the TV would not turn on. I contacted customer service and have sent it out to them to fix/get a new tv. I will update once I receive the new one.	5.0	9/26/2015
walmart.com	I bought this for my son&#39;s room so he could play his Xbox with friends. I did not bring cable tv into his room so the tv was hooked directly to the Xbox using the directions provided. So nothing on our end could contribute to the fact that the tv just died after 15 months. Thankfully I bought the extended warranty so let&#39;s see what they can do. I&#39;ve plugged it into another outlet, still a black screen, hooked it up to my cable tv and just a black screen. So we bought a Vizio and if this one gets working I have a new tv. But I have a feeling it won&#39;t be for long.	5.0	9/27/2015

walmart.com	This TV was bought for our office, and it would be used on occasion for TV watching and also for our grandchildren to play video games on. After hooking it up I found the picture and sound quality to be far below what I would have accepted. I ended up paying about $50 more and got a LG 32&#34; TV which has been perfect in every way! In our home we already have a 50&#34; LG and a 37&#34; Vizio and love them both. Maybe I&#39;m just spoiled for what I feel is good quality. I knew I wouldn&#39;t be happy with the Sceptre, so paying a little bit more was well worth my TV enjoyment...	Items in cart	10/2/2015

walmart.com	This is a fair bargain for the price. The picture is good and it&#39;s an easy set up and light weight. Only draw backs are the sound and the occasional HDMI port input change. The sound in extremely poor. I had to hook up to a surround system to be able to adjust the volume to levels where I could actually hear the programming. There have also been a couple times that the tv changes input for no apparent reason (ex. HDMI 1 to HDMI 2). That one puzzles me. Occasionally, the sound will go out completely if I am watching something on DVR and switch back to reg tv. That is fixed when I change channels. Overall for the price, you can&#39;t beat it if you have a sound bar or audio system you can connect to it.	5.0	12/23/2014

walmart.com	Decent TV for price, but the old say &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; rings true for this one. The picture is OK but the volume is pathetic. The speakers are on the bottom of the TV so if you simply want to use the TV stand and not a wall mount, you can barely hear the TV (even when turned to 100% of its capacity). I bought it for my mother for Christmas so was unable to get home to check on it for her until Feb (she lives in Alabama, I live in Seattle). I contacted Septre for technical support. They said (after only owning the TV for 2 months) that I would need to package it up and ship it back to them at my own expense for them to troubleshoot and repair. Not satisfied at all.	4.0	2/6/2015
walmart.com	Bought TV online at Wal-Mart.com was weary because I had never heard of the brand. Packaging was very good a lot of time went into the packing of the tv and accessories. The tv looked great and I was pleased with the ease of assembly. They even supplied a screwdriver to install the stand which was a nice touch. However....the top half of the screen went black as I started the channel search and never resolved. Just half of the screen went dead. So I ignored the do not return to store statement on the instructions and returned it to Wal-Mart the next day for another brand I had never heard of as this brand is not carried in stores. New tv not as nice looking but has a great picture so I am pleased that the return process was easy.	4.0	2/8/2015
walmart.com	I bought this to use as an external monitor when my laptop screen went on the fritz. Works great for that purpose for as long as it lasted, but the screen died after just 16 months of use. That&#39;s right - just four months after the warranty expired. I did my due diligence and read as many reviews of this TV as i could find, and all praised the picture quality, but i wish I could have found some by people who had owned it more than a few months.

walmart.com	The Sceptre 32&#34; Class LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV (X322BV-HD) didn&#39;t work out of the box. The screen came on for a split second then went black. Apparently, if you take it apart, remove a couple of capacitors from the power supply, and replace them with better ones it will work for a while (average of a couple months). I decided to not take a brand new TV apart to see if I could fix it. I exchanged it at my local Walmart for a 32&#34; Element HDTV.

I returned it to Walmart - IN STORE and recommend anyone else who has this problem to do so as well.. don&#39;t bother shipping it back, just get the receipt and take it to customer service... they will refund or exchange it.

walmart.com	We just purchased this tv for our 9yr old son for Christmas, to replace his perfectly working, smaller one. Once hooked up, it had little squiggly lines running across the screen, which eventually cleared up. We weren&#39;t sure if it was the tv, or a problem with the cable, because we were actually having issues with that at the time also. But oddly enough, the tv started turning ON by itself. We would turn it off, and 5 minutes or so later, it would just pop right back on. Every time, its a different amount of time....and POP, right back on !! Very disappointed... nobody wants a tv that turns on by itself at various times of the day or night. You want it to turn OFF ... when you want it to.... not surprise you and just POP on !	5.0	4/20/2012
walmart.com	Unfortunately I had to return this item on 2/27/12. It was a Christmas gift for my son. After two days it started having horizontal lines appear at the bottom of the screen.

I feel bad that I did not have this same experience. I did have high hopes!	5.0	4/24/2012

walmart.com	This TV worked great for only 1 month! Then while watching a show, it went totally blank. I tried exchanging at the local store but the Sceptre brand is only sold online.

walmart.com	This TV&#39;s picture wet black after a couple months of having it. You get what you pay for here. The price was low because the quality was low. I was able to return it to the manufacture to have it fixed under the manufacturer&#39;s year warranty I sent it back a week and a half ago and will not receive it for approximately 3 weeks. The warranty is good if it blacks out under a year but it will take a whole month to have it shipped, fix and returned. Customer service was horrible. This whole purchase was a nightmare! If i could give this TV no stars rather than 1 I would. NEVER AGAIN.	Walmart. Save Money. Live Better.	6/26/2012
walmart.com	Purchased in June 2012. First one failed right out of the box, with a long line of pixels turned on white permanently. Exchanged in store. Second one just failed with a &#34;pop&#34; sound as I turned it on, a terrible smell, and actual smoke out the top. This is March 2013. I used it as a secondary tv in the bedroom, so it really didn&#39;t get much use. I figure I turned it on maybe 25-30 times total in 9 months. Really no excuse for this. I&#39;ll have to pass on Sceptre next time around.	Clear search field	6/30/2012
walmart.com	This Sceptre TV seemed like an awesome deal but if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is true. This TV suddenly stopped working after 4 months of daily use. Up to that point it was very good. I did purchase the additional warranty so if you buy a Sceptre, be sure to purchase the warranty. I probably bought a lemon as the other reviews are mostly positive.	Search	7/8/2012
walmart.com	Im a college student and I bought this TV for my new apt back in July so its almost been a year since I&#39;ve had it...it was a GREAT buy initially until last week it rained really hard and all of a sudden the TV picture has gone black. Ive tried resetting the TV (unpluging cables) and nothing has worked. I contacted Sceptre because technically Im still &#34;covered&#34; by the company&#39;s one year warranty...well apparently labor fees and shipping on this size of a TV is well over $250...I didn&#39;t even pay that much for the freakin TV?? So...needless to say Im urked. Im all about finding mere quality vs name brand but honestly your better off just investing in a Sony or something. This TVs are known to start well and finish stupid and thats why its so cheap.	Items in cart	7/8/2012

Eventually, the television shut itself off and will no longer show a picture in the screen when turned on.

walmart.com	Very disappointed. We bought this 32&#34; Sceptre from Walmart.com in May of 2012 for occasional use in the bedroom. We received it on 6/1/2012. It quit working today (June 21, 2013). The picture flashes on and off, one time displaying half of the screen for a second, then back off. It occasionally displays a red horizontal line across the middle for a second or so. We normally expect a TV to last more than three weeks beyond the warranty period.	5.0	9/18/2012
walmart.com	We got this TV as a Christmas gift, it was not hooked up until after New Years. No matter what we did the color and picture were always off and the sound varied. Not long into February the jacks in the back to hook the game system and dvd player into came loose and the connection would short out. If anything is on the screen (like a title screen of a movie or wii menu) for any length of time the image is &#34;burned&#34; into the screen and you will see it even as a new show plays. I am now attempting to return this waste of money. I guess it is true you get what you pay for	5.0	10/5/2012
walmart.com	The power board failed after 18 months of moderate use in our bedroom. The company wanted $100 to replace the power board and $50 for shipping and handling.

These blow out anytime between 90 days (for one of them) and 12 months (for 2nd one purchased). You cannot get ahold of their warranty department, the phone number just rings off the hook!

walmart.com	We bought this TV for my grandson for Christmas 2012. By May, audio was out... no sound from internal speakers, external speakers, headphones, etc. It was under warranty, so we sent it in for repair. It was returned after 1 month with the audio repaired. Now, after another month of use, the picture and audio is out... nothing works except the &#34;on&#34; light. We are sending it back again for repair, still under warranty, but we do not have any confidence in the product. I would not be surprised if it has more problems before the end of the year. On the plus side, their customer service has responded to my emails within a few days (for the most part). And, since the TV is still under warranty, it has not cost us anything to repair. Maybe we just got a &#34;lemon&#34;, but after a quick review of other reviews, it seems that this model has a high percentage of catastrophic failures. My recommendation would be to avoid this TV and buy a name brand.	5.0	12/1/2012

walmart.com	I received this as a gift. I was disappointed with it being from this retailer and heard bad reviews of this brand line. The sound quality is awful unless you have a surround sound. These style TVs aren&#39;t built to last, so do yourself a favor and pick up the extended warranty for this one or buy elsewhere. That competing big box wholesale store has TVs at a slightly higher price point with MUCH better warranty of 2 years for all TVs and an additional 3 years on top of the 2 for less than $50. Great bargain unless you want it to last for more than 20 months. The features are pretty solid and the picture quality itself was good enough -until it stopped working.	5.0	12/21/2012

Keep in mind,not the most expensive.With that said,the sound quality isn&#39;t that great, and after a few months ,the sound complety went out and we had to return it.

From what I read over the weekend, this is a common theme with all buyers of this brand of TV. I&#39;m so disappointed. The value was great that was the main appeal but I&#39;m disappointed for falling for value over quality. Who wants to replace a TV after only 16 months? From what I&#39;ve read it will cost more to repare it rather than just replace it. Do not buy unless you dont mind replacing your electronics every 15 - 18 months. If I would have known, I wouldnt have even bought this for my child.	5.0	11/22/2013
walmart.com	while the picture quality was pretty good , the sound tends to be tinny....used it as a monitor for my pc..which was satisfactory. Had the product for less than a year when the on off switch began to have problems, until finally it failed to turn on the screen. There aren&#39;t any local places to take it for repair. It has to be sent back to the factory. I had called the Company and they said it was likely a failed circuit board. I don&#39;t have my purchase documents so will likely just trash it and buy something better..	5.0	11/23/2013
walmart.com	Have had about a year. TV will power on but screen will not turn on. Have to unplug &amp; replug more &amp; more to get screen to come on! JUNK TV!!	5.0	1/28/2014
walmart.com	I purchased two of these TV&#39;s. Neither made it through the first year. Sceptre customer service is not customer oriented or friendly at all. They do not provide you with details on whether the TV is services or replaced. They avoid any pertinent questions or concerns and refuse to accomodate for the inconvenience. Each time the TV malfunctioned we went 1 - 3 months without a TV. The first unit we purchased in 2012 and have been through 4 units. We have finally decided to throw in the towel and purchase a new TV and never again buy a Sceptre product.	5.0	3/21/2014
walmart.com	I stupidly bought 3 of these things ,the 1st ones screen went black in less than 8 weeks,the 2nd one in 27 days and this last one you can&#39;t hardly get the power button to work, sometimes it takes up to 10 times of disconnecting it and hitting the power button again to get it to come on,but I know its only a matter of time before it will completely stop working. I should have paid attention to the reviews could have saved myself a lot of time,trouble and aggrevation. Never will I buy this brand again, even if they have a 5 for the price of 1 sale.	5.0	3/31/2014

walmart.com	We bought several of these tvs and half of them made it passed three months. The picture would go out but sound was still there and we spent $75 plus dollars to fix them. So these tvs are were no help to us and now we have to replace them not even a year later.	5.0	7/25/2014
walmart.com	There is not a manufacturers code to set this up with my cable box. I have to use 2 remotes and if I forget which one to use for what, I have to start over. Instructions only cover &#34;without a cable box.&#34; The sound is awful, not anything like what I expected. It is tinny and not at all what I exected. What the heck did I buy????? I thought I was getting a good deal and a new TV, but this is not at all what I expected. I do not like it, but it would cost me more to return it....let&#39;s just say I am not happy and prefer to just keep it off than turn it on and listen to the silence. I hate it. What did I buy here?	5.0	11/30/2013

We took the TV to a Walmart back and thanks to their great exchange service, picked out anoyher TV. It was another brand, I had to pay addl. $ 21 because of the price diffrence. This TV is not sold in our local Walmarts. But I am happy now.	Menu	12/5/2013

walmart.com	I bought this TV for my mom, after years of not having a new one, after reading the reviews. I figured since the majority of the reviews held this TV in high regard, I figured I&#39;d go for it. However, I regretted that decision the minute the TV was hooked up. TV picture was god awful!!! And the sound quality was even worse (maybe because the speakers are facing underneath the TV???). My mom&#39;s 20 year old tv had better picture and sound then this TV. Returned it to the store after 1 day! Going to buy a Vizion 32inch which has been rated one of the best TVs buy CNET and PCMag.
