The phone is more than averege. Yet, there are some drawbacks- NO 4G,back cover is too thin, head phone is outdated,sound quality is very very poor,no flip cover available at the market now, apps are not movable to sd card, etc. other than these the device is good.

It can change your display setting and can also change the firmware of your TV. So be careful. Picture can go dark and HDMI ports can become unresponsive. It is better to check on internet for your model of Tv has any comparability problem with chromecast.

gcbfkt	Jul 12, 2015	5
Awesome product by Google . Superb connectivity with no lag . More better buying any android box for tv . Connect Pc and tablet and phone . You can also play games from your android device on a big screen without any lag .

kittu	Aug 31, 2015	5
have been using this for about 2 months now and i cant stop getting amazed at the versatility of this device. while it makes watching videos from youtube and other online sources very easy, one can also use the plex app to cast local media from the laptop or hard drives.

Sarthak	Oct 04, 2015	5
it is very good to watch our mobile videos and YOUTUBE  in TV

kunn	Oct 03, 2015	5
I am satisfied with the product I am sure even others will like it

vikas gupta	Oct 03, 2015	5
Excellent product at this price. If you have a fairly good broadband connection then you will enjoy streaming youtube videos, mp3 songs, movies etc. on to the LED TV. This product is updated regularly by google and more and more apps are available on play store which are chromecast enabled. Go fot it.

A good handy camera. really like it

DrAmit	Sep 20, 2015	4
This is worth buy. The Sleek and lightweight grip of the body make things easy. Timelapse video recording is also very good. Grip Sensor works very fine. Not checked with the waterproof resistance yet. It can capture motions in the camera perfectly. General Video recording is in 1080p but slowmotion video recording is not in 1080p. You can edit settings in the app. To install the app you must have buletooth 4.0 or wifi direct and android 4.3 above. Overall its a good buy. Waiting for all the mounts available in Indian Market.

parvinderrakhra	Dec 11, 2014	5
I bought this HTC RE Camera in December and it's started cracking from bottom of the body. Picture and video quality is excellent but as per HTC it's waterproof, but now it's not waterproof for me. So as per me build quality is so poor and not worth to buy it.

Saurabh	Feb 09, 2015	5
Awesome camera.. Loving all the wide angles and the flexibility of holding it from different perspectives. The RE app for the phone (Android + Apple) is fantastic. Tells you everything you need to know about the camera's settings and viewing photos are simple and convenient. However there is a little image stability issue with the RE. One move and the picture goes shaky but with a little precision and practice it's a terrific buy for the price and specs!

rajesh	Oct 01, 2015	4
Nice features, Good Quality, handy and From a reputed Company.

Sandeep payal	Sep 25, 2015	5
an affordable cam for daylight use and under water(with the waterproof cap which has to be purchased seperately) photography ,quickly connects with android devices (i tried with oneplus one )but if we have to buy accessories and it is  hard to find them in offline stores and as well as online stores

Riya	Sep 25, 2015	5
Video quality is mind-blowing. Remote photo capturing using phone feature makes RE better than other options.

Prd	Sep 24, 2015	5
Stealthy product, light weight and a good quality camera.

Bhagi	Sep 22, 2015	5
Taking video and pictures with this camera is one touch operation .easy to carry and even fits in pocket extra added water proof fecility without any outer housings is a ausome thing to use it in rainy situations too.definetly ill recommend
